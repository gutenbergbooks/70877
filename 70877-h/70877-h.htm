<h2>Chapter I. <br> Our Special Correspondent</h2>

<p>“If,” said Roger Sheringham, helping himself
to a third piece of toast, “your brain had as many
kinks in it as your trousers have few, Anthony, you
would have had the intelligence to find out our train
from St. Pancras this morning before you ever arrived
here last night.”</p>

<p>“There’s a telephone here and an enquiry office at St.
Pancras, I believe,” retorted his cousin. “Couldn’t the
two be connected in some way?”</p>

<p>“You write to me and ask me to waste my valuable
time in amusing you on your holiday,” Roger pursued
indignantly. “I not only consent but very kindly allow
you to choose the place we shall go to and book our
rooms for us; I even agree to harbour you here for a
night before we start and submit to your company and
your chattering at my own breakfast-table (a thing
peculiarly offensive to any right-minded man and
destroying at one blow the chief and abiding joy of
bachelorhood). I do all this, I say, and what is my reward?
You refuse point-blank even to find out the time of
our train from St. Pancras!”</p>

<p>“I say, did you see this?” exclaimed Anthony,
glancing up from the <i>Daily Courier</i>. “Kent all out for
forty-seven on a plumb wicket at Blackheath! Whew!”</p>

<p>“If you were to turn to the centre of the paper,”
replied Roger coldly, “I think you might find some rather
more interesting reading matter than the performances
of Kent on plumb wickets at Blackheath. The editorial
page, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Meaning there’s another of your crime articles in?”
Anthony asked, flicking back the pages. “Yes, I’ve been
reading some of them. They’re really not at all bad,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much indeed,” Roger murmured
gratefully. “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!
Anyhow, you understood them, did you? That’s good.
I was trying to write down to the standard of
intelligence of the ordinary <i>Courier</i> reader. I appear to have
succeeded.”</p>

<p>“This is rather interesting,” Anthony remarked, his
eyes on the required page.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said Roger modestly, folding up his
napkin. “I did rather flatter myself that I’d⸺”</p>

<p>“This article on ‘Do Shingled Heads Mean Shingled
Hearts?’ By Jove, that’s an idea, isn’t it? You see what
he’s getting at. Boyishness, and all that. He says⸺”</p>

<p>“I think you’ve mistaken the column,” Roger
interrupted coldly. “The one you’re looking for is on the
right, next to the correspondence.”</p>

<p>“Correspondence?” repeated Anthony vaguely. “Oh,
yes; I’ve got it. ‘Clergymen Who Gabble. Sir: I
attended the burial service of my great-aunt by marriage
last Thursday and was exceedingly distressed by the
slipshod way in which the officiating clergyman read
the⸺’ ”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll go for a holiday with you, Anthony,
after all!” observed Roger suddenly, rising to his feet
with such vehemence that his chair fell violently to the
floor behind him.</p>

<p>“You’ve knocked over your chair,” said Anthony,
quite seriously.</p>

<p>At this point, very fortunately, the telephone-bell
rang.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Roger into the mouth-piece, more
loudly than was strictly necessary.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” answered a voice. “Is that Mr.
Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“No! He left for Derbyshire early this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come!” chided the voice gently. “Not before
eleven o’clock, surely. He wouldn’t go without his
breakfast, would he?”</p>

<p>“Who’s speaking?”</p>

<p>“Burgoyne, <i>Daily Courier</i>. Seriously, Sheringham,
I’m very relieved that I’ve caught you. Listen!”</p>

<p>Roger listened. As he did so his face gradually
cleared and a look of intense excitement began to take
the place of the portentous frown he had been wearing.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid it’s out of the question, Burgoyne,”
he said at length. “I’m just off for a fortnight in
Derbyshire with a cousin of mine, as you know. Rooms booked
and everything. Otherwise I should have been
delighted.”</p>

<p>Expostulatory sounds made themselves heard from
the other end of the wire.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll think it over if you <em>like</em>,” Roger replied
with a great show of reluctance, “but I’m very much
afraid— Anyhow, I’ll let you know definitely in a
quarter-of-an-hour. Will that do?”</p>

<p>He listened for a moment, then hung up the receiver
and turned to Anthony with a beaming face. “Our
little trip’s off I fear,” he said happily.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” exclaimed Anthony. “But—but we’ve
booked our rooms!”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em>’ve booked them,” Roger corrected. “And there’s
nothing to prevent you from occupying them. You can
sleep in one and brush your hair in the other, can’t you?
Of course I shall be delighted to reimburse you for any
expense you may have incurred through your
misunderstanding that I would accompany you, though I must
take this opportunity of pointing out, without prejudice,
that I am not legally liable; and should my heirs or
fellow-directors dispute the claim, my solicitors will
have instructions not to⸺”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” Anthony shouted.
“Why do you want to back out at the last minute like
this? What’s happened? Whom were you talking to
then?”</p>

<p>Roger resumed his seat at the breakfast-table and
poured himself out another cup of coffee.</p>

<p>“To take your questions in inverse order,” he said
at length, and with a slight diminution of his bantering
air, “that was the editor of the <i>Daily Courier</i>, a very
great man and one before whom politicians tremble and
duchesses stand to attention. You may remember that
I had some truck with him last summer over that
Wychford business. He wants me to go down at once to
Hampshire as Special Correspondent to the <i>Courier</i>.”</p>

<p>“To Hampshire?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t know whether you saw a little
paragraph in the papers yesterday about a woman who fell
over the cliffs at Ludmouth Bay and was killed. The
idea now appears to be that it might not have been an
accident after all, and there’ve been one or two
important developments. They want me to follow up those
articles I’ve been doing by covering the business for them,
to say nothing of putting in a little amateur sleuth-work
if the chance arises. It’s a job after my own heart!”</p>

<p>“But I heard you say that it was out of the question,
because you were going away with me?”</p>

<p>Roger smiled gently. “There’s a way of doing these
things, little boy, as you may find out when you get a
little older. But, seriously, you’ve got the first claim on
me; if you’re dead set on this Derbyshire trip, I’ll come
like a shot and chuck the other.”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Anthony said warmly. “I wouldn’t
dream of it. What do you take me for? Run off and
sleuth to your heart’s content. I may even buy
the <i>Courier</i> once or twice to see how big an idiot you’re
making of yourself.”</p>

<p>“If you can drag your eyes away from the cricket
page! Well, it’s jolly sporting of you to take it like this,
Anthony, I must and will say. I know how maddening
it is to have one’s plans upset at the last minute.”</p>

<p>“I dare say I shall be able to survive it,” Anthony
opined philosophically, stuffing tobacco into his pipe.
“I’m not much of a whale for my own company, it’s
true, but I’ll probably fall in with somebody or other
up there; one often does. Baccy?”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Roger took the extended pouch and
transferred some of its contents to the bowl of his own pipe
with a somewhat absent air. Suddenly his face cleared
and he smote the table lustily. “I’ve got it! Why on earth
shouldn’t you come too? It ought to be interesting
enough and I’d be jolly glad of your company. Of
course!”</p>

<p>“But the other rooms have been booked,” Anthony
demurred.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, stop harping on the bookedness
of those rooms! You’re getting positively morbid about
them. They can be cancelled, can’t they? Would
you <em>like</em> to come down with me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would.”</p>

<p>“Then go out and cancel them by wire, and I’ll send
the woman a cheque from Ludmouth; so that’s settled.
I’ll ring up the <i>Courier</i> and say I’ll go, and then I shall
have to fly down there and see them before I start.
There’s a train for Bournemouth at twelve-ten, I know,
because I caught it a fortnight ago. Greene will have
got my bag packed by now, so after you’ve wired come
back here and collect the luggage and go on to
Waterloo. Take two first singles to Ludmouth and I’ll meet
you in front of the little place where you book for
Sandown Park five minutes before the train goes.
Shoot!”</p>

<p>“What’s your second name, Roger?” Anthony asked
admiringly. “Pep or Zip?”</p>

<p>As he made his way down the main stairs of the
building in which Roger Sheringham’s bachelor flat was
situated, Anthony Walton smiled slowly to himself. The
little holiday he had fixed up with Roger was going to
be even more amusing than he had expected.</p>

<p>Although there were more than ten years between the
cousins (Roger was now thirty-six, Anthony a bare
twenty-five), they had always been good friends, and
that also in spite of the fact that they had scarcely a
taste or a feeling in common. It is often remarked, and
even by people whom one would certainly expect to
know better, that opposites make a happy marriage.
Nothing could be more ludicrously untrue, but they do
frequently make a happy male friendship. This one was
a case in point.</p>

<p>Anthony, big, broad-shouldered, good-natured and
slow-witted, had got his blue for rugger at Oxford,
and now regularly left his father’s office, where he sat
and amiably did nothing for the rest of the week, each
Saturday morning to play for the Harlequins. It was
his secret opinion that games were the only things that
mattered in this world. In the matter of brains he was
no match for the keen-witted if slightly volatile Roger,
and his slow deliberation was in equal contrast with
that gentleman’s dynamic energy; nor did he possess
enough imagination to be impressed in the slightest
degree by his cousin’s fame as a novelist with an already
international reputation, though he did afford him a
qualified respect as the owner of a half-blue for golf
obtained at Oxford nearly fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>With his usual methodical care Anthony set about
carrying out the string of orders which had been
entrusted to him. Seven minutes before the train was due
to leave he took up his position, tickets in hand, at the
appointed spot on the vast surface of Waterloo Station.
Punctually two minutes later Roger appeared and they
passed through the barrier together, followed by a
staggering porter with their combined traps. The train was
not full, and an empty first-class smoker was obtained
without difficulty.</p>

<p>“We’re going to enjoy ourselves on this little trip,
Anthony, my son,” Roger remarked as the train began
to move, settling himself comfortably in his corner and
beginning to unfold a large wad of newspapers which
he had brought with him. “Do you know that?”</p>

<p>“Are we?” Anthony said equably. “I shall enjoy
watching you on the trail, certainly. It must be a strange
sight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now I come to think of it, you’re by way
of being rather indispensable there yourself, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Me? Why?”</p>

<p>“As the idiot friend,” Roger returned happily. “Must
have an idiot friend with me, you know. All the best
sleuths do.”</p>

<p>Anthony grunted and began somewhat ostentatiously
to turn the pages of <i>The Sportsman</i> with which he had
prudently armed himself. Roger applied himself to his
bundle of papers. For half-an-hour or more no word
was spoken. Then Roger, throwing aside the last
newspaper from his batch, broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I think I’d better give you the facts as far as I can
make them out, Anthony; it’ll help to stick them in my
own memory too.”</p>

<p>Anthony consulted his wrist-watch. “Do you know you
haven’t spoken for thirty-six minutes and twelve seconds,
Roger?” he said in tones of the liveliest astonishment.
“I should think that’s pretty nearly a record, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“The name of the dead woman was Vane,” Roger
continued imperturbably; “Mrs. Vane. She appears to
have gone out for a walk with a girl cousin who was
staying with her, a Miss Cross. According to this girl’s
story, Mrs. Vane sent her back as they were
approaching the village on their way home, saying that she wanted
to call round and see a friend on some matter or other.
She never got there. A couple of hours later a fisherman
turned up at the police-station and reported that he had
seen something on the rocks at the foot of the cliffs as
he was rowing out to some lobster-pots half-an-hour
earlier, though it had apparently not occurred to him to
go and see what it was. A constable was sent off to
investigate, and he and the fisherman climbed down the
cliffs, which seem to be fairly well broken up at that
point. At the bottom they found Mrs. Vane’s body. And
that was that.”</p>

<p>“I believe I did see something about it,” Anthony
nodded. “Wasn’t it an accident?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what everybody thought, of course; and
that was the verdict at the inquest yesterday, Accidental
Death. But this is the important development.
The <i>Courier’s</i> local correspondent caught a glimpse of
Inspector Moresby, of all people, prowling about the place
this morning! He telephoned through at once, and⸺”</p>

<p>“Inspector Moresby? Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you must have heard of him. He’s one of the big
noises at Scotland Yard. I suppose he’s been mixed up
in nearly every big murder case for the last ten years.
Anyhow, you see the idea. If Moresby’s on the job, that
means that something rather important’s going to
happen.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! You mean she was murdered?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Scotland Yard seems to think she was,”
Roger agreed seriously.</p>

<p>Anthony whistled softly. “Any clues?”</p>

<p>“None that I know of, though of course they must be
working on something. All the local man can tell us is
that Mrs. Vane was a charming woman, quite young
(twenty-eight, I think Burgoyne said), pretty, attractive,
and very popular in the neighbourhood. Her husband’s
a wealthy man, a good deal older than herself and a
scientist by hobby; in fact quite a fairly well-known
experimentalist, I understand.”</p>

<p>“Sounds queer!” Anthony ruminated. “Who on earth
would want to murder a woman like that? Did you gather
whether any motive had come to light?”</p>

<p>Roger hesitated for a moment. “What I did gather is
that the girl cousin benefits to the extent of over ten
thousand pounds by Mrs. Vane’s death,” he replied
slowly.</p>

<p>“Oho! That sounds rather rotten, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does,” Roger agreed gravely.</p>

<p>There was another little pause.</p>

<p>“And you’ve got to write about it for the <i>Courier?</i>”
Anthony remarked almost carelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes; as far as we know we’re the first in the field.
It’ll be a decent little scoop if we’re the only people to
come out with the news about Moresby to-morrow
morning. I shall have to fly off and have a chat with him the
moment we arrive. Luckily I know him slightly already.”</p>

<p>“Take your seats for lunch, pleece,” observed a head
popping suddenly into the carriage from the corridor.
“Lunch is now being served, pleece.”</p>

<p>“I say, Roger,” Anthony remarked, as they rose
obediently, “what put you on to this crime business?
Before that Wychford affair, I mean. You never used
to be keen on it. What made you take it up?”</p>

<p>“A certain knotty and highly difficult little problem
which I had the felicity of solving about two years ago,”
Roger replied modestly. “That made me realise my own
powers, so to speak. But I can’t tell you names or
anything like that, because it’s a most deadly secret. In
fact, you’d better not ask me anything about it at all.”</p>

<p>“Right-ho, I won’t, if it’s a secret,” Anthony promised.</p>

<p>Roger looked slightly disappointed.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch02">

<h2>Chapter II. <br> Girls and Murder</h2>

<p>Ludmouth village is nearly a mile away from its
station. On arriving at the latter Roger and Anthony
put their traps in the combined ticket-office, porter’s
room, luggage depot and cloakroom, and proceeded to
make enquiries regarding hotels.</p>

<p>“ ’Otel?” repeated the combined porter, station-master
and ticket-inspector, scratching the top of his head with
an air of profound cogitation. “Why, there ain’t no ’otel
’ereabouts. Leastaways, not what you might call an ’otel,
there ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, a pub, then,” rejoined Roger a trifle irritably.
The journey had been a long and tiresome one, and
since changing at Bournemouth they had seemed to
progress at the rate of ten miles an hour. For one who was
as eager to get going as Roger had been all that day, few
things could have been more maddening than the
journey as habitually performed between Bournemouth and
Ludmouth. It is not to say that the train does not go fast
when it is going, but stations seem to demoralise it
completely; it sits down and ruminates for a matter of
twenty minutes in each one before it can bring itself to
go on to the next. “What’s the name of the best pub in
Ludmouth?”</p>

<p>The combination chuckled hoarsely. “The best pub?”
he echoed with considerable amusement. “The <em>best</em> pub,
hey? Oho! Hoo!”</p>

<p>“I’ve said something funny,” Roger pointed out to
Anthony. “You see? The gentleman is amused. I asked
the name of the best pub, so no wonder he’s convulsed
with mirth.”</p>

<p>Anthony inspected the combination with some
attention. “I don’t think he’s laughing at you at all. I think
he’s just seen a joke that Gladstone made in 1884.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nobbut one!” roared the combination.
“So when you says the <em>best</em> pub I⸺”</p>

<p>“Where is the one pub in Ludmouth?” asked Roger
patiently.</p>

<p>“Why, in the village, o’ course.”</p>

<p>“Where is the village of Ludmouth and its one pub?”
Roger pursued with almost superhuman self-restraint.</p>

<p>This time a more lucid reply was forthcoming, and the
two strode out into the hot sunshine and down the country
road in the direction indicated, leaving behind them a
combination of porter, station-master and ticket-inspector
guffawing at irregular intervals as some fresh aspect
of this cream of jests appeared to occur to him.</p>

<p>It was a warm walk into the village, and they were
glad enough to plunge into the gloom of the little
old-fashioned inn which stood in the middle of the small
cluster of houses which constitutes the nucleus of the
village. A smart rap or two on the counter brought the
landlord, a large man of aspect not unlike a benevolent
ox and perspiring almost audibly.</p>

<p>“Can’t serve you, gents, I’m afraid,” he rumbled
cheerfully. “Leastaways lemonade you can have, or
ginger-beer, for the matter of that; but nothing else.”</p>

<p>“That so?” said Roger. “Then produce two large
tankards of beer, the biggest tankards and the wettest
beer you’ve got, for we came not as travellers but as
residents.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean you want to stay ’ere as well? You
want rooms?”</p>

<p>“Rooms we shall want, certainly; but what we want
just at the moment is beer—and don’t forget what I
told you about the size of those tankards.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s a different matter, that is,” agreed
the landlord. “I can let you have a couple of quart
tankards, if they’re any use to you.”</p>

<p>“Any <em>use?</em> You watch!”</p>

<p>With much wheezing and creaking the landlord filled
the two huge tankards, and the two fell upon them
gratefully. Then Roger replaced his on the counter and
wiped his mouth.</p>

<p>“So this is the only inn hereabouts, is it?” he asked
with a careless air.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it is that. Ludmouth’s a small village, you
see, as far as the village goes.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s far more big ’ouses round and gentry
and suchlike than there is of us villagers, and naturally
they don’t want public-’ouses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Yes, quite so. By the way, I believe there’s
a friend of mine somewhere about here called Moresby.
You seen or heard of him by any chance?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Moresby?” beamed the landlord. “Why he’s
staying ’ere, he is. Took ’is room this very mornin’,
he did. Well, fancy that!”</p>

<p>“Fancy it indeed! You hear that, Anthony? Dear old
Moresby staying under the very same roof-tree! What
do you think of that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” Anthony agreed.</p>

<p>“I should say so.” He took another pull at his tankard.
“Been having some excitement down here, landlord,
haven’t you? Lady fell over a cliff, or something?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vane, sir? Yes. Very sad business, very sad
indeed. A wonderful nice lady she was too, they say,
though I can’t say as how I knew ’er meself. A bit of
a stranger in these parts, she was, you see. ’Adn’t been
married to the doctor more nor five years.”</p>

<p>“The doctor? Her husband is a doctor, is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, in a manner o’ speaking he is. He’s always
called Dr. Vane, though he don’t do no doctoring. Plenty
o’ money he’s got now and always ’as ’ad since he
settled ’ere twenty or more years ago, but a doctor he was
once, they do say, an’ Dr. Vane he’s always called.”</p>

<p>“I see. And where does he live? Near here?”</p>

<p>“A matter of a mile or so out Sandsea way; big ’ouse
standin’ in its own grounds back from the cliffs. You
couldn’t miss it. Very lonely, like. You might take
a stroll out there and see it if you’ve got nothing to
do.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, yes, we might, mightn’t we, Anthony?”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” said Anthony cautiously.</p>

<p>“But first of all about these rooms. How many have
you got vacant, landlord?”</p>

<p>“Well, besides Mr. Moresby’s, there’s four others
altogether. If you’d like to step up in a minute or two
and see ’em, you could choose which ones you’d like.”</p>

<p>“We won’t bother. We’ll take them all.”</p>

<p>“What, all four of ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes; then we can have a bedroom and a sitting-room
apiece, you see.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a sitting-room downstairs I could let
you ’ave. A proper sitting-room.”</p>

<p>“Is there? Good! Then we’ll take that too. I love
proper sitting-rooms. That’ll be five rooms altogether,
won’t it? I should think that ought to be enough for
us. What would you say, Anthony?”</p>

<p>“I think that might be enough,” Anthony assented.</p>

<p>“You see, landlord? My friend agrees with me. Then
that’s settled.”</p>

<p>“It’ll cost you more, sir,” the landlord demurred in
some bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Of course it will!” Roger agreed heartily. “Ever so
much more. But that can’t be helped. My friend is a
very faddy man—a very faddy man indeed; and if he
thinks we ought to have five rooms, then five rooms we
shall have to have. I’m very sorry, landlord, but you
see how it is. And now I expect you’d like us to pay
you a deposit, wouldn’t you? Of course. And after that,
there are our bags and things to be got from the
station, if you’ve got a spare man about the place; and
you might tell him from me that if the red-faced man
who hands them over begins to make curious noises all
of a sudden, he needn’t take offence; it only means that
he’s just seen a joke that someone told him the year
Queen Victoria was born. Let’s see now; a deposit, you
said, didn’t you? Here’s ten pounds. You might make
me out a receipt for it, and be careful to mention all
five rooms on the receipt or I shall be getting into
trouble with my friend. Thanks very much.”</p>

<p>The landlord’s expression, which had been growing
blanker and blanker as this harangue proceeded,
brightened at the sight of the two five-pound notes which
Roger laid on the counter; words may be words, but
money is always money. He had not the faintest idea
what it was all about and it was his private opinion that
Roger was suffering from rather more than a touch of
the sun, but he proceeded quite readily to make out the
required receipt.</p>

<p>Roger tucked it away in his pocket-book and,
professing a morbid interest in the late Mrs. Vane, began
to ask a number of questions regarding the exact spot
where she had fallen over the cliff and how best to get
there. This information having been obtained and the
conveyance of the bags arranged for, he shook the
puzzled landlord heartily by the hand and drew
Anthony out into the road.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you know what you’re doing,”
remarked that young man, as they set off briskly in
accordance with the landlord’s instructions, “but I’m
blessed if I do. Why on earth did you book four
bedrooms?”</p>

<p>Roger smiled gently. “To prevent all the other little
journalists from sharing our advantage in staying under
the same roof as Inspector Moresby of Scotland Yard,
Cousin Anthony. A dirty trick, no doubt; but
nevertheless a neat one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Very cunning. And where are we off to
now? The cliffs?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You see, I want to get hold of Moresby as
soon as I possibly can, and it seems to me that if he
only arrived here this morning he’ll still be hanging
round those cliffs; so the best thing I can do is to make
for them too.”</p>

<p>“Seems a sound scheme. And after that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I ought to try to get an interview with one
of the people at the house, I suppose, though I don’t
much fancy the idea of tackling the doctor himself.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Vane? No, dash it, you can hardly butt in on
him.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I feel. He has a secretary, I believe,
though I don’t know what her name is, and of course
there’s the girl cousin, Miss Cross. She’s the person one
ought to make for, I think.”</p>

<p>Anthony frowned. “Seems rather rotten to me.”</p>

<p>“To interview her? Not necessarily, at all. She might
have something to say that she’d very much like
published. She knows that the uncompromising fact about
that ten thousand pounds is going to be talked about
pretty hard if there’s any question of Mrs. Vane’s death
not being an accident; naturally she’d like an
opportunity of putting an indirect answer of her own
forward.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” Anthony confessed, his
frown disappearing.</p>

<p>“Nor did I, till this minute,” Roger said candidly.
“Still, it’s true enough. And there’s a little job for
you, Anthony. I shan’t want you with me while I’m
talking to Moresby; it’s going to be difficult enough to
get anything out of him in any case, but your presence
would probably dry him up altogether. So you might
stroll along the cliffs, locate the Vanes’ house, and
see if you can discover unobtrusively any information
as to the girl’s movements or where I might be likely
to catch her—outside the house, of course, if possible.
What about that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could do that for you. And meet you later
on?”</p>

<p>“Yes; just stroll back along the top of the cliffs again
and I shall be sure to run into you. Well, there’s the
sea not three hundred yards ahead, and nothing but
nice, open downs along the top of the cliffs up there.
We turn off to the right, I suppose, and you go straight
along while I make for the edge just over there. I
expect I shall be through in something under an hour. So
long!”</p>

<p>As Anthony made his way leisurely over the springy
turf in the direction in which he judged his objective
to lie, he pondered with no little interest over the object
of their journey down to this charming part of the world
and its possible outcome. There was in his make-up none
of that eager curiosity regarding his fellow-creatures,
their minds and the passions which sway them that had
led Roger, after the way had once been opened to him,
to explore the vast field of criminology with all its
intense and absorbing interest for the student of the human
animal. Indeed the notion of nosing out hidden facts
and secret horrors (“like a bally policeman,” as he had
contemptuously phrased it to Roger over their lunch on
the train) had at first actually repelled him; it was
not until Roger had been at considerable pains to point
out the moral duty which every living person owes to
the dead that his eyes were opened to any wider
conception of the idea. And even then, though admitting that
there must be detectives just as much as there must be
hangmen, he was quite firm in his gratitude to
Providence that he at any rate was not one of them; nor
could Roger, expatiating on the glories of a clever piece
of deductive reasoning, the exquisite satisfaction of
logical proof, the ardour of the chase with a human
quarry (but none the less a quarry that in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred deserved not a jot of mercy)
at the end of it, move him an inch from this position.</p>

<p>It was this state of mind which had caused him to
receive with ominous disapproval Roger’s pointed
information about the girl cousin and her ten thousand
pounds. A girl, to Anthony’s mind, should not be
mentioned in the same breath as the word murder. Girls
were things apart. Murder concerned men; not girls.
Girls might be and very often were murdered, but not
by other girls. If it were distasteful to hunt down a
man suspected of murder, how impossible would it not
be to harry a wretched girl in the same circumstances?</p>

<p>As his thoughts progressed with his steps, an idea
began to form in Anthony’s mind. He would not only seek
out the whereabouts of Miss Cross, as Roger had asked
him; he would contrive to speak to her for a minute or
two and, if possible, drop a veiled warning as to the
things that might be expected to happen—that were, in
fact, even now happening—together with an equally
veiled hint that at any rate he, Anthony Walton, was
prepared to extend to her any help within his power,
should she wish to accept it. After all, that was the least
a chap could do. It was the only decent thing. Ten to
one she wouldn’t need anything of the sort, but the
offer—yes, of course it was the only decent thing to do.
Girls were weak, helpless things. Let them know they’ve
got a man behind them (even a perfect stranger if the
case is serious enough to warrant it) and it makes all
the difference in the world to ’em. Naturally!</p>

<p>In the glow of this resolution Anthony had
unconsciously directed his steps toward the sea, so that he
was now striding along the very edge of the cliffs.
Coming to his senses with a jerk, he pulled up short and
looked inland. Not five hundred yards to his right there
stood, in a large fenced area which evidently stretched
to the road half-a-mile away, a big red house. As the
landlord of the inn had said, there was no mistaking it.
Anthony gazed at it for a few moments without
moving; now that he was face to face with it, the task of
penetrating its purlieus and demanding speech with an
unknown lady in order to warn her against dangers
which quite probably did not exist at all, suddenly took
on a somewhat formidable aspect.</p>

<p>His eyes left its red roof and began, probably with
an instinctive idea of looking for help, to sweep the
remainder of the view, arriving in due course at the
edge of the cliff just in front of him. At this point
Anthony started violently, for seated on a small grassy
ledge not a dozen feet below the cliff top, which was
crumbled away at the point to form a steep but not
impossible slope down, was a girl who was occupied
in gazing as hard at Anthony as he had been gazing
at the house. As his glance at last fell upon her she
also started, coloured faintly, and hurriedly transferred
her eyes to the horizon in front of her.</p>

<p>On an impulse Anthony stepped forward and raised
his hat.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, “but I am looking for
Dr. Vane’s house. Could you tell me if that is it?”</p>

<p>The girl twisted half round to face him. She wore
no hat, and the sun glinted on her dark hair, unshingled
and twisted in two coils on either side of her head; the
eyes with which she looked at Anthony were large and
brown, and the simple little black frock she was wearing
suited her lithe, graceful body so well that one would
have said she should never wear anything else.</p>

<p>“I thought you must be,” she said calmly. “Yes, it
is. Did you want to see anyone in particular?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; I— That is, I rather wanted to see Miss
Cross.”</p>

<p>The girl suddenly stiffened. “I am Miss Cross,” she
said coldly.</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br> Inspector Moresby Is Reluctant</h2>

<p>The village of Ludmouth lies about half a mile
back from the sea. At the nearest point to the village,
where Roger and Anthony had left the road to strike
across open country, the water had broken in upon the
stern lines of the high cliffs which form the coast-line
for several miles in either direction. The result is a
tiny little inlet, almost completely circular in shape,
which has been dignified by the name of Ludmouth Bay.</p>

<p>At either horn of this minute bay, which could hardly
have been more than a couple of hundred yards wide,
the cliffs rise almost sheer to a height of at least a
hundred feet, to sink gradually down as they follow the
bay’s curve into a strip of sandy beach at the
innermost edge, whence a steep track leads up to the village
on the high ground behind. It is a charmingly
picturesque spot and, lying as it does a little way off the beaten
track, has not yet been spoiled (except for occasional
excursion parties on bicycles from the neighbouring
town of Sandsea, half-a-dozen miles away to the West)
by the ubiquitous tripper; for the roads on all sides are
too steep and too dangerous for char-à-bancs—a matter
of much comfort to those of the inhabitants who keep
neither public-houses nor banana shops.</p>

<p>The cliffs which stretch toward Sandsea face the
open sea with considerably less frowning austerity than
those to the East; they slope slightly backward instead
of dropping sheer, and are so irregular and split up
into huge boulders, clefts and rocky knobs, as to be by
no means impossible for a determined man to climb.
About a third of the way down their face they bear a
narrow ledge, which proceeds more or less level for
a considerable distance and has been turned, by means
of a flight of steps cut in the rock at either end, into a
pathway. At one time this pathway had been in some
favour among the lads of the village as a place from
which to fish when the tide was high; but customs change
even in Ludmouth, and nowadays anyone in search of
solitude could usually be sure of finding it here. To
add to its advantages in this respect, a bulge in the
rock just above served to hide it completely for nearly
its whole length from the eyes of anybody standing on
the top of the cliff overhead. Inspector Moresby, sitting
on a low boulder at a spot where the ledge widened out
to a depth of nearly a dozen feet, could be observed
from nowhere except the open sea.</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby was as unlike the popular idea
of a great detective as can well be imagined. His face
resembled anything but a razor, or even a hatchet (if
it must be compared with something in that line, it was
far more like a butter-knife); his eyes had never been
known to snap since infancy; and he simply never
rapped out remarks—he just spoke them. Let us not
shirk the fact: a more ordinary-looking and ordinarily
behaved man never existed.</p>

<p>To proceed to details, the inspector was heavily-built,
with a grizzled walrus moustache and stumpy, insensitive
fingers; his face habitually wore an expression of
bland innocence; he was frequently known to be jovial,
and he bore not the least malice toward any of his
victims.</p>

<p>At the moment of our introduction to him he was
gazing with an appearance of extreme geniality, his chin
on his knuckles and one elbow perched on either knee,
at a small rowing-boat half-a-mile out at sea; but his
expression was not inspired by any feeling of affectionate
regard for the boat’s horny-handed occupant. He
was, indeed, quite unaware of the boat’s existence. He
was engaged in wondering very intensely how a lady
could have managed to fall accidentally off this ledge at
the particularly broad part where he was now sitting;
and why, if the lady had not fallen off accidentally but
had been committing suicide, she should have done so
with a large button from somebody else’s coat tightly
clenched in her right hand.</p>

<p>Quite an interesting problem, Inspector Moresby had
decided; interesting enough, at any rate, to call him
over semi-officially that morning from Sandsea, where
he had been in the middle of his annual holiday with
his wife and two children, to look into the matter a
little further pending instructions from Scotland Yard
and the county police authorities.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps advancing along the path from
the East caused him to glance up sharply, his face just
a shade less genial than usual. The next moment a
stockily-built man, hatless and wearing a pair of
perfectly shapeless grey flannel trousers and a disreputable
old sports coat, and smoking a short-stemmed pipe with
an enormous bowl, came into sight round a bend in the
path, walking rapidly.</p>

<p>The newcomer slowed up at sight of the inspector and
glanced at him with an air of elaborate carelessness.
A look of equally elaborate incredulity appeared on his
face, then he smiled widely and hurried forward with
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Inspector Moresby! Well, fancy seeing
you here, Inspector! You remember me, don’t you? My
name’s⸺”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sheringham! Of course I remember you, sir,”
returned the inspector warmly, shaking the other’s hand
with great heartiness. “Shouldn’t be likely to forget
you after enjoying your books so much, you know, let
alone the way you astonished us all at the Yard over
that business at Wychford. Let’s see now, it was with
Mr. Turner of the <i>Courier</i>, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. The ‘Hattan Garden jewel case,’ as the
papers called it. Well, Inspector, and what are you doing
in this peaceful part of the world?”</p>

<p>“I’m on my holiday,” replied the inspector with
perfect truth. “Staying over at Sandsea with the wife and
children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Roger innocently.</p>

<p>“And how do you come here, sir? Holidaying too?”</p>

<p>Roger winked broadly. “Me? Oh, no. I’m down here
in pursuit of a new profession that’s just been thrust
upon me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir? What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, to put it quite bluntly, I’m down here to ask
Inspector Moresby on behalf of the <i>Courier</i> what he’s
got to tell me about a lady who fell off the cliff
somewhere about here a day or two ago, and why such an
important person as he should be so interested in an
ordinary accident.”</p>

<p>The inspector rubbed his chin with a rueful grin.
“And I’d just strolled over here from Sandsea to get
away from the crowds for a bit!” he deplored
innocently. “I’ve only got to yawn at the wrong time, and
there’s half-a-dozen gentlemen of your new profession
round the next minute asking what the significance is.”</p>

<p>“Going to have a nice nap before you go back to
Sandsea?” Roger asked with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“A nap?”</p>

<p>“Yes; at least, I don’t suppose you booked that room
at the Crown just to brush your hair in, did you?”</p>

<p>The inspector chuckled appreciatively. “Got me there,
sir! Well, I may be staying over here for a day or two,
yes. Even accidents can have their interesting side, you
know, after all.”</p>

<p>“Especially an accident that isn’t an accident, eh?
Come on, Inspector; you can’t put me off like that, you
know. I’m developing a nose like a bloodhound’s for
this sort of thing, and it’s busy telling me very hard
that you’ve got something up your sleeve. What’s the
idea? Can’t you give me a pointer or two?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that perhaps I mightn’t. I’ll think
it over.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you do it now? Just a few words to send
the <i>Courier</i> before the other johnnies turn up. I’ll get ’em
to splash your name all over it, if that’s any good to
you. Come now!”</p>

<p>The inspector considered. He was never averse to
having his name splashed about in an important paper like
the <i>Courier</i> if the circumstances warranted it. As long
as the bounds of discretion were not overstepped a little
publicity never did a police officer any harm, and it
has frequently done him a great deal of good.</p>

<p>“Well, without saying too much, I don’t mind telling
you that there <em>are</em> one or two suspicious circumstances,
Mr. Sheringham,” he admitted at length. “You see, the
lady was supposed to have been alone at the time when
she fell over here.”</p>

<p>“At this very spot, I take it?” Roger put in.</p>

<p>“At this very spot. But I’m not at all sure—not
at <em>all</em> sure!—that she was alone. And that’s really all I
can say at present.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think she wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The inspector looked exceedingly mysterious.
“I can’t go so far as to tell you that, but I think you
can let your readers know that I’m not speaking
altogether at random.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Inspector Moresby, who has the matter in hand,
intimated that he has discovered an important clue.
While not at liberty to disclose the precise nature of
this, he assured me that important developments may be
expected shortly,’ ” Roger intoned solemnly.</p>

<p>“Something like that,” the inspector laughed. “And
of course I needn’t point out to a gentleman like you
how improbable it would be for anyone to fall over
accidentally just here where this ledge is so deep.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded. “Suicide, by any chance?”</p>

<p>“May have been,” agreed the inspector in a
perfectly expressionless voice.</p>

<p>“But you’re quite sure it wasn’t!” Roger smiled.
“Eh?”</p>

<p>The inspector laughed again. “I’ll be able to let you
know a bit more later on, no doubt, sir. In the
meantime⸺” He paused significantly.</p>

<p>“In the meantime you’d be very much obliged if I’d
stop these awkward questions and leave you in peace
again? I get you, Inspector. Very well. But you don’t
mind if I just have a look round here before I go, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, Mr. Sheringham,” said the inspector
heartily. “By all means.”</p>

<p>It was with a mild feeling of resentment, however,
in spite of the inspector’s friendly reception of him,
that Roger embarked upon a cursory examination of
the ledge on which they were standing. It was more in
the nature of a demonstration than anything else, for
he knew perfectly well that there would be nothing for
him to find; Inspector Moresby would have seen to that.
No doubt it was perfectly right and proper to withhold
from him the clues which he had most certainly
discovered—no doubt at all. But Roger did think the
man might have treated him somewhat differently from
an ordinary reporter, especially after his reference to
Wychford. It was annoying in a way; decidedly
annoying. And still more annoying was the fact that he had
nothing whatever to be annoyed about. In the inspector’s
eyes he was a reporter, and that was all there was to
it; he had come down here as a reporter, he was acting
as a reporter, he <em>was</em> a reporter. Hell!</p>

<p>As he had expected, the ledge yielded nothing at all.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he observed, straightening up from a
boulder behind which he had been peering. “Nothing
much here. And no signs of a struggle either.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be, on this rocky surface,” the
inspector pointed out kindly. “Too hard to take
impressions, you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that idea occurred to me,” Roger remarked a
trifle coldly. He walked over to the western end of the
ledge, where it narrowed down rapidly into a pathway
not more than four or five feet wide, and began to stroll
along it.</p>

<p>He had scarcely covered half-a-dozen paces before the
inspector’s voice pulled him up with a jerk. “Not that
way, if you want to get back, sir. I shouldn’t go that
way if I were you; it’s very much longer. You’ll find
the way you came a good deal shorter.”</p>

<p>Roger started slightly. “Oho, old war-horse!” he
murmured to himself. “So the ears are pricking, are they?”
He turned about and scrutinised the inspector with
interest. “Now I wonder just exactly why you don’t want
me to go this way, Inspector?”</p>

<p>“It’s no matter to me, sir,” returned the inspector
very innocently. “I was just trying to save you a bit
of a walk round, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I see. But do you know, I think I should like a bit
of a walk round,” Roger remarked with some care. “I
feel it would do me good. Clear my brain, and all that.
Good-bye, Inspector; see you later, no doubt.” And he
set off again, though more slowly this time, in the
confident expectation of being called back once more.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed.</p>

<p>“I see I shall have to tell you,” said the inspector’s
resigned voice behind him. “But you understand, I don’t
want this mentioned yet awhile, sir. I’m not scaring my
bird just at present if I can help it—always provided
there is one, of course. Come with me, and I’ll show
you.”</p>

<p>He led the way a few yards farther along the path
and paused in front of a wide patch of dry mud. Plainly
marked in the mud were the imprints of two pairs of
feet, both women’s, one pair decidedly larger than the
other; the deep impressions of the high heels were clean
and distinct.</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Roger softly, staring hard.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s why I said the lady wasn’t alone,” the
inspector pointed out. “I’ve ascertained pretty certainly
that she came along from this end, you see, and these
marks were made yesterday morning or thereabouts. It’s
a bit of luck that they haven’t been obliterated since, but
everyone else seems to have come and gone from the
other end as it’s so near the steps. I’ve tried the shoes
she was wearing, by the way, and they fit exactly in
the smaller impressions. That’s nothing like so important
as the story-books make out, of course (I dare say
there are at least twenty pairs of shoes even in this
small place which would fit one or other of those
prints); but it’s a point worth mentioning for all that.”</p>

<p>Roger turned eagerly from his contemplation of the
mud. “This is jolly significant, Inspector; anyone can
see that. But it doesn’t absolutely destroy the accident
theory, does it? Not alone. No, I’m ready to bet you’ve
got something else up your sleeve as well.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I have, sir,” twinkled the inspector,
who was not feeling inclined to talk about coat-buttons
just at the moment. “Perhaps I have. But you must take
it from me that this is all I can tell you for the
moment, and that last bit isn’t for publication yet awhile
either, you won’t forget.”</p>

<p>They turned and walked back to the ledge again.</p>

<p>“Where was the body found?” Roger asked. “In the
water?”</p>

<p>“No, a couple of feet above high-water mark. You
see that big rock down there—the one with the seaweed
half-way over the top and a bunch of yellow limpets
on this side? Well, wedged between that and the smaller
one this side of it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Roger thoughtfully, gauging the distance
from the edge of the ledge. A person tumbling straight
over the edge would miss it by feet; quite a respectable
little jump would be needed to reach it. A jump, or—a
push! Furthermore, there was, straight down below the
ledge, a deep pool among the rocks into which anybody
just tumbling over must inevitably have fallen. Mrs.
Vane’s body had cleared the pool and landed on the
boulders beyond it. The inference was obvious; any
question of an accident was now almost definitely ruled
out. It was a matter of suicide or murder.</p>

<p>Roger turned to the inspector. “There’s been a post
mortem, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes. This morning.”</p>

<p>“Were any bones broken?”</p>

<p>The inspector smiled. “Oh, yes; plenty. She hadn’t
been murdered anywhere else and put there, if that’s
what you’re getting at.”</p>

<p>“It did cross my mind,” Roger smiled back. “I needn’t
ask whether anyone saw anything from the sea?”</p>

<p>“No, I was making enquiries on those lines this
morning, myself. Unfortunately there don’t seem to have
been any boats out here at all just then. But the old
fisherman who subsequently discovered the body seems
to think he heard a scream coming from this direction
about an hour beforehand; in fact, he says that’s
probably what made him look over here as he was rowing
past. But he didn’t pay any attention to it at the time,
thinking it was some dratted girl being tickled—his
own words, by the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” observed Roger, the light in his
eye belying his laconic words. “By the way, I suppose
you’ve been down to those rocks?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m afraid I haven’t,” said the inspector a
little guiltily. “I should have done, I know, but I’m not
built for climbing down from here, and I don’t seem
to have had time to get round there in a boat. In any
case, I’m pretty sure there’d be nothing to find. The
constable who recovered the body brought her hand-bag
and her parasol, and he said he’d had a good look
round. Strictly between ourselves, Mr. Sheringham, I
was going to assume that his eyes are as good as mine;
but don’t put anything about that in the <i>Courier</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to think that over,” Roger laughed.
“Anyhow, I’m a man of stern duty: I’m going to see if I
can scramble down and poke round. I know there won’t
be anything to find, but it’s the sort of thing that gives
one a lot of satisfaction afterward to have done.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you stumble and pitch on the rocks too,”
said the inspector humorously. “Somebody might come
along and accuse me of things.”</p>

<p>The way down was not nearly so difficult as it looked
from above. Everywhere the face of the cliff was so
seamed and fissured that foothold was easy, while
half-way down a great piled-up pyramid of boulders
provided a kind of giant’s staircase tolerably simple to
negotiate. Within five minutes of leaving the inspector,
Roger was standing on the big rock beside which Mrs.
Vane’s body had been found.</p>

<p>For some minutes he poked about, peering into pools
and religiously exploring the recesses of every cranny,
while the inspector kept up a running commentary upon
the habits of crabs, lobsters and other sea-going
creatures which lurk in dark holes awaiting an opportunity
to deal drastically with exploratory hands; then he stood
up and swept a brief glance round before beginning the
climb back.</p>

<p>“No,” he called up to the inspector, who had just
finished recounting an anecdote about the grandfather
of a friend of his who had been stung to death by a
jellyfish while paddling among the rocks off Sandsea.
“Nothing here! Now tell me a story about the
great-aunt of another friend of yours who fell down a
hundred feet when rock-climbing in Cumberland. I shall be
ripe for something like that in about five minutes, when
I’m clinging on to that last bit of cliff up there with
my teeth and eyebrows.”</p>

<p>The obliging inspector instantly embarked on the
anecdote required, and at the same moment Roger, in
mid-stride between two boulders, noticed something
white glistening below him. Action was almost
instinctive.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” exclaimed the inspector in concern,
breaking off his narrative abruptly. “Hurt yourself?”</p>

<p>Roger picked himself up slowly and brushed a little
green slime off his trousers with his hands. “No, thanks,”
he called back cheerfully. “Not a bit!” And he went on
brushing himself with his hands.</p>

<p>He couldn’t use his handkerchief, because that was
lying in his breast pocket, wrapped about the piece of
paper on top of which he had skilfully stage-managed
his fall.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch04">

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> Anthony Interviews a Suspect</h2>

<p>Anthony had not had very much experience with
women. In the brief instant after the girl had spoken it
occurred to him with some force that his ideas on the
subject might require drastic revision. Women were not
necessarily weak, helpless creatures. Names such as
Joan of Arc, Boadicea, Florence Nightingale, Queen
Elizabeth, occurred to him with startling rapidity. Were
they weak, helpless creatures? They were not. Nor was
the girl who was standing in front of him and
regarding him now with cold, haughty eyes. Anybody less weak
and helpless, anybody more obviously capable of
looking after herself could hardly have existed.</p>

<p>“I am Miss Cross,” she repeated in frigid tones.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>Anthony’s tongue seemed to have become jammed.
His mission, which had seemed a moment before so
altogether right and proper, suddenly took on the aspect
of the most fatuous thing ever conceived by misguided
human mind. Even to connect this beautiful, proud
creature with the mere idea of bare self-interest
appeared a kind of blasphemy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I—I wanted to speak to you for a minute,” he
managed to stammer. “But it doesn’t matter.” At this
point Anthony ought to have turned about and run off
at top speed with his tail between his legs, making a
noise like a flat pancake. But he couldn’t. By some
curious action of nature his feet seemed to have taken
root in the ground.</p>

<p>“Are you connected with the police?” the girl asked
with incredible scorn.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens, no!” cried Anthony, genuinely
shocked. “I should think not! Great Scott, no! Good
Lord, no!”</p>

<p>The girl’s uncompromising attitude relaxed slightly.
“Then why did you want to see me?” she asked, as if
very few people except the police ever wanted to
see <em>her</em>.</p>

<p>“Well, it was just about something I thought I ought
to tell you,” Anthony mumbled. “But it doesn’t matter.
I see that now. It doesn’t matter a bit.”</p>

<p>Curiosity could be seen struggling with resentment
in the girl’s face. Strangely enough, curiosity won.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me that you’ve come all this
way out to speak to me, and now you’ve got here you’ve
decided that it doesn’t matter?” she said, and actually
a faint hint of the merest shadow of a suspicion of a
smile flitted for a quarter-of-a-second into and out of
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve seen you, I’m quite sure it doesn’t matter,
Miss Cross,” Anthony said simply.</p>

<p>“Well, thank Heaven my appearance seems to impress
somebody favourably,” murmured the girl wearily,
more to herself than the other, and for an instant the
mantle of pride she had been wearing seemed to drop
from her and she looked utterly forlorn and miserable.</p>

<p>Anthony was emboldened into a sudden decision. “I’ll
tell you why I came, Miss Cross, after all. I just came
to say that if you wanted any help in the present
circumstances, I should be very proud to— That is to say,
I should like you to know that—I mean⸺” He ceased
floundering, for the girl’s eyes were regarding him
steadily with an expression in their depths which he was
finding peculiarly disconcerting.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand you,” she said
haughtily. “I was not aware that I needed any ‘help.’ ”</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” Anthony stammered. “Naturally
not! I was only thinking that⸺”</p>

<p>“And I must decline to discuss my private affairs
with a stranger! So if there is nothing else⸺” She
paused, obviously waiting for him to go.</p>

<p>Anthony felt himself becoming annoyed. He knew
that his recent embarrassment had made him look a
fool and he resented the fact; he knew that his motive
in seeking speech with this girl had been a completely
altruistic one and here she was treating it as a piece of
unwarrantable impertinence, and he resented that still
more.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he said stiffly, “there is nothing more
to be said, and I must apologise for bothering you.
Though I think you should understand,” he added on
the impulse of the instant by way of a parting shot
as his temper momentarily got the better of his
manners, “I think you should understand that possibly your
private affairs will soon be becoming of some interest
to the public at large, Miss Cross.”</p>

<p>The girl coloured violently and for a moment seemed
incapable of speaking. Her eyes blazed, she clinched her
small fists by her sides and her dark head was flung back
as if to meet an actual attack.</p>

<p>“If you’ve come here to insult me⸺” she choked
out.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t!” said Anthony in considerable alarm
at this unexpected result of his thrust. “I simply meant
that I’ve come down here with a friend of mine who’s
working for the <i>Daily Courier</i> and he said something
about getting you to give him an interview. I thought
you ought to know.”</p>

<p>As abruptly as it had arisen the girl’s anger
disappeared and something very like fear took the place of
the fire in her eyes. She stared at Anthony widely.</p>

<p>“A—a <em>reporter?</em>” she muttered. “Good Heavens, has
it come to that now?”</p>

<p>Men are curious creatures. A moment ago Anthony
was severely annoyed and wanted nothing better than
to make this extremely crushing young lady severely
annoyed too. The instant he had succeeded in doing so,
he had been filled with alarm. Now that he had changed
her mood once more, from anger to fear, he began to
feel the worst kind of inhuman brute imaginable.</p>

<p>“No, but look here,” he said eagerly, “there’s nothing
to be alarmed about. They always do it, you know.
Interviews and all that. He’s an awfully nice chap too.
Roger Sheringham, the novelist, you know. Cousin of
mine, as a matter of fact. I dare say he won’t try to
see you at all if you don’t want him to. Sure he won’t!
I’ll tell him, shall I? Dash it all, there are crowds of
other people he can interview if he must interview
somebody. I was against it at the time, to tell you the truth,
but he thought you might want to be interviewed for
some reason or other. I’ll tell him, Miss Cross. Don’t
you bother about that. I’ll see it’s all right.”</p>

<p>It was doubtful if the girl had understood a single
word beyond the general drift of what Anthony was
saying. She continued to stare at him; but mechanically,
as if paying attention only to her own thoughts. When
next she spoke her voice was under control again, though
her words were a little halting.</p>

<p>“Then am I to understand that—that the London
papers are taking an interest in—in my cousin’s death?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they are,” said Anthony humbly,
apologising for the London paper <i lang="la">en masse</i>.</p>

<p>The girl shifted her gaze and contemplated the
horizon with unseeing eyes, busy again with her thoughts.
Anthony, judging he had received permission to exist
a little longer, made advantageous use of his reprieve
by contemplating her.</p>

<p>She really was extraordinarily pretty, he had no
difficulty in deciding. He liked her slimness and grace,
he liked the way her head was set on her neck, he liked
the way her black hair curled over her ears, he liked
her wrists and her small feet, he liked— But why reduce
Margaret Cross to a catalogue? There was nothing about
her Anthony did not like. When he got back to his
lodgings he would probably think this over and the
realisation would suddenly strike him that this was the one
girl in the world for him—expressly designed and
manufactured by a thoughtful Providence for the sole
purpose of delighting, harassing, maddening and ultimately
very greatly gratifying one Anthony Walton, bachelor.
The realisation had already struck him exactly
twenty-three times before and twenty-three times he had
mistaken the intentions of Providence; but this time it was
the <em>real</em> thing. It always was.</p>

<p>Anthony continued his contemplation, each second
more raptly than before.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl appeared to come to a decision. She
turned to him with an impulsive movement, and to his
relief Anthony saw that she was smiling.</p>

<p>“Will you come and sit down here a minute,
Mr.⸺?”</p>

<p>“Walton!” Anthony supplied hastily.</p>

<p>“Mr. Walton. I owe you an enormous apology, I’m
afraid. It was very kind indeed of you to think of
coming along to give me warning. I was a pig to you.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” Anthony averred, scrambling eagerly
down the little bank to join her on the little grassy ledge
a dozen feet down from the cliff’s lip. “It was most
natural. I ought to apologise if anyone should.
Frightfully tactless.”</p>

<p>“Not at all!” said the girl warmly. “It was entirely
my fault. But if you’ll forgive me, we’ll say no more
about it. Now let’s sit down here and make ourselves
comfortable, because I’m going to take you at your
word.”</p>

<p>“Do, please,” Anthony said earnestly, as he seated
himself on the warm, springy turf at her side. “I should
be awfully proud.”</p>

<p>The girl clasped her arms round her knees and stared
out to sea. Anthony, glancing at her covertly, noted with
approval the firm and resolute lines of her profile. She
could not be more than one- or two-and-twenty, he
decided, but even he could read an experience beyond her
years of the world, its trials and its anxieties in the
tiny lines of care about her mouth and the faint
markings on her white forehead.</p>

<p>“You said something about my needing help,” she
said slowly, as if choosing her words with care. “Well,
why should I be silly and pretend I don’t? I do need it.
You don’t know me, and I don’t know you; but I feel
I can trust you, and there’s nobody else to whom I can
speak. Not a single soul. I suppose you know
that—that⸺”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Anthony interrupted gently. “I think I know
all the facts.”</p>

<p>“I supposed so, or you wouldn’t have said that.” She
fixed her big, sorrowful brown eyes on Anthony’s face.
“But what you don’t know, Mr. Walton, is that a police
inspector from Scotland Yard was with me for nearly
two hours this morning, asking me the most <em>horrible</em>
questions!”</p>

<p>A cold hand seemed to lay itself over Anthony’s
heart. “I say, was he really?” he muttered. “No, I didn’t
know that.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. She opened her mouth to speak
again, but her lips trembled and she turned her head
quickly away. A little quiver shook her body. Then
suddenly the control that had borne her up all this time,
ever since that dreadful interview in the morning, gave
way before Anthony’s silent sympathy. She buried her
face in her hands and burst into tears.</p>

<p>“He seems to think—oh, the most awful things!”
she sobbed.</p>

<p>Anthony stared at her in dismay. It was bad enough
that she should have burst into tears at all, without the
terrible significance of her last words. He was certain
that Margaret Cross was not the sort of person to give
way to tears unless matters had reached an acute crisis;
the fact that she had done so impressed him with the
seriousness of the situation even more than had her
decision to confide in himself, a complete stranger. She
must be not only utterly alone in the world; she was
very nearly at the end of her tether as well.</p>

<p>Masculine sympathy with distressed femininity is
nearly always inarticulate (distrust it when it is not!),
but fortunately it has resource at its command far
superior to mere words. Anthony did not stop to think.
He acted instinctively. Putting his arm about her he
drew her toward him without a word and laid her
head on his shoulder. Almost gratefully she buried her
face in the hollow of it like a small child seeking
consolation from its mother and continued to weep.
Anthony had the wisdom to let her go on doing so without
attempting a single word of clumsy consolation—though
indeed it is doubtful whether he would have been able
to do so had he wished, for he was vaguely feeling
himself almost sanctified by contact with something
rather holy and, for such an outwardly unemotional
Briton, there was a most unusual lump in his throat as
he looked down on the sleek dark head sheltering against
his rough coat and felt the sobs shaking the slim body
he held in his arms.</p>

<p>By degrees the girl’s weeping subsided. Her form
ceased to quiver and she gently disengaged herself from
Anthony’s encircling arm.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool,” she said, looking at him with rather a
watery smile. “Is my nose disgustingly red?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” Anthony lied stoutly, considerably
relieved by the smile. “It’s ripping.”</p>

<p>Margaret dived into her bag and produced a little
mirror. Sounds of dismay issued from her, and a
powder-puff was hastily brought into action.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” she observed a minute or two later,
scrutinising her image with close attention. She turned
and faced Anthony with a frank smile that was a tacit
acknowledgment of the bond between them. “Will you
ever forgive me for making such an idiot of myself?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” Anthony said slowly, “I don’t want to
butt in on anything you don’t want to tell me, but
wouldn’t you like to tell me the whole story? You know
I’m only too anxious to do anything I possibly can to
help you, and matters seem to be a bit—well, a bit more
serious even than I’d thought. If you would like to let
me know the whole circumstances⸺?”</p>

<p>He paused, and the girl nodded understandingly.
“You mean it’s no good asking you to help me unless
you know what I’m up against?” she said thoughtfully.
“Well, that stands to reason. Of course I’ll tell you. I
was going to before as a matter of fact, only I⸺” She
left the sentence unfinished and, hunching her knees,
resumed her former pose and gazed out to sea.</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I smoke?” Anthony asked,
producing his pipe.</p>

<p>“Of course not. In fact I rather feel I need a cigarette
myself. No, don’t you bother!” she added quickly, as
Anthony felt in his pockets. “I’ve got some of my own
particular brand here, and I hardly ever smoke
anything else.”</p>

<p>She produced a cigarette-case from her bag, and
Anthony held a match for her, lighting his own pipe from
it afterward. She drew one or two deep inhalations and
sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>“Well, about myself; there’s really very little to tell
you. Four months ago I was in London, broke to the
wide—as I had been off and on for the last seven years.
My father was an officer in the regular army; he was
killed in France in 1917, when I was fifteen years old.
I inherited about two hundred pounds from him and,
of course, a pension; the pension was just enough to
keep body and soul together if one lived on rice and
cold water, but not much more.” She paused for a
moment as if in thought.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” she went on with a touch of
cynicism, “it appears that my father had ‘married beneath
him.’ I don’t remember my mother at all (she died
when I was a baby), but I believe that she was the
daughter of a fraudulent bucket-shop proprietor in
Liverpool who had served two terms of imprisonment
and my father was more or less entrapped into
marriage with her when he was a young subaltern. He never
hinted a word of all this to me, by the way; don’t
think that. He was a dear. But it’s been rubbed into me
pretty thoroughly since by other charming people.”</p>

<p>“I say,” Anthony put in in acute distress, “please
don’t tell me anything you’d rather not. I mean⸺!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the girl in a hard voice. “Why
shouldn’t I tell you everything? That police inspector
seems to know all about it. Probably it will be in all
the papers to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But⸺” Anthony shifted his position and relapsed
into uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>“Well, the consequence was that my father had been
cut off by his family. They wouldn’t have anything more
to do with him. Nor would they with me. One of his
brothers sent five hundred pounds to daddy’s solicitors
to provide for my education and keep me till I was old
enough to earn my own living, but that was as far as any
of them would go. I’m not complaining; in the
circumstances it was remarkably generous of him. That money,
with my own two hundred, kept me till I was eighteen,
after that I had to earn my own living. You’ve probably
heard that girls had some difficulty in getting jobs after
the war. It’s perfectly true. I was trained as a
shorthand-typist, but unfortunately nobody seemed to want a
shorthand-typist. But I got work all right. I had to.
During the last three years I’ve been a governess, a
shop-assistant, a waitress and a parlour-maid.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” Anthony breathed.</p>

<p>The girl laughed suddenly with genuine amusement.
“Oh, you needn’t pity me for the last. That was the
best of the lot. I can’t think why I didn’t try it sooner.
Governessing was the worst I think; but they do work
waitresses rather hard, I must admit. Well, that sort
of thing went on for three years, as I told you; and then
I was dismissed from my proud position of parlour-maid
by an irate lady because her husband wanted to
kiss me and was tactless enough to try with the door
open. I boxed his ears for her, but apparently that wasn’t
enough, so I was turned out, with a month’s wages in
my bag. I’d just come to an end of them and was
beginning to wonder rather desperately where the next was
to come from, when I got a letter from Elsie—Mrs.
Vane, you know.”</p>

<p>Anthony nodded. “Your cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes; her mother was my mother’s sister. I’d never
seen her in my life—hardly even heard of her, in
fact—but to my astonishment she said that she’d heard I
was having rather a rough time and, as she had plenty of
money of her own, would like to extend a helping hand,
so to speak. Anyhow, the upshot was that she invited
me to come and live here, nominally as her companion
and with a quite generous salary.”</p>

<p>“Jolly decent of her,” Anthony commented.</p>

<p>The girl glanced at him rather queerly. “Yes, wasn’t
it? And very extraordinary too. But there was something
more extraordinary to come. A day or two after I had
arrived she broke the news to me quite casually that
she had made a new will that morning leaving all her
money and everything else unconditionally to me—ten
thousand pounds or more, to say nothing of her
jewellery. As you can imagine, I was absolutely astounded.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. But how topping of her!”</p>

<p>“Very,” said the girl drily. “But you see the position
it puts me in—combined with my excellent grandfather.
Rather—difficult, to say the least, isn’t it? And the
trouble is that I’ve simply nobody to advise me. The
solicitor who managed my affairs is dead; George—Dr.
Vane—is—well, he’s not the sort of person one
could talk to about this sort of thing; nor is Miss
Williamson, his secretary. I’m absolutely alone.” She tossed
her cigarette out over the sea and laughed a little
bitterly. “So now perhaps you can understand why I’m
ready to take into my confidence the very first person
who comes along—though even that doesn’t excuse my
howling on his shoulder, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“It’s a perfectly damnable position,” growled
Anthony. “I’d like to wring that inspector’s neck. But one
thing’s perfectly clear. You must talk all this over with
my cousin. He’ll help you if anyone can, and I’m sure
he won’t use anything you tell him for the <i>Courier</i>
without your consent.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded slowly. “Ye-es, perhaps that would
be best. Roger Sheringham, you said, didn’t you? I’ve
read some of his books. I think he must be rather a nice
person.”</p>

<p>“He is. He’d talk the hind-leg off a dead mule, but
he’s a thoroughly decent chap. Got a half-blue at
Oxford, you know. Well, look here, I was to meet him on
these cliffs about this time; supposing if I dash off
and collect him and bring him along right away? I don’t
think we’ve any too much time to waste, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re awfully kind, Mr. Walton,” said the girl
gratefully. “I shall lie awake for hours to-night
cursing myself for being such a perfect pig to you when you
first arrived.”</p>

<h2>Chapter V. <br> Roger Takes Up the Cudgels</h2>

<p>On the whole Roger was feeling not a little
pleased with himself as he emerged on the top of the
cliffs once more after his interview with Inspector
Moresby. That the inspector had one or two facts up
his sleeve (and probably highly important facts at that)
was not a matter for doubt; on the other hand Roger
had gleaned considerably more information than he
had really expected. There was too at that moment
reposing in his breast pocket the piece of paper he had
picked up within a couple of yards of the spot where
the body had been found, about the existence of which
the inspector had not the slightest suspicion. Two
people could play at the same game of withholding
information! He began to walk rapidly in the direction
in which he had arranged to meet Anthony.</p>

<p>Fifty yards ahead of him the ground rose to form
a little hillock; once over that Roger felt that it would
be safe enough to examine his find without fear of
interruption. His hand was actually inside his pocket as
he breasted the rise when the figure of Anthony appeared
suddenly over the top. On seeing him Anthony broke
into a run.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Anthony!” said Roger mildly. “You seem in
a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” Anthony began breathlessly and
without preamble. “Look here, I’ve seen Miss Cross and it’s
jolly serious. That infernal inspector’s been up there
and nearly frightened the life out of her. I want you to
come along and speak to her. And let me tell you, Roger,
that things are getting a bit thick. Anybody who’s
hinting things about that girl ought to be taken out and
shot. The poor kid’s⸺”</p>

<p>“Here, wait a minute!” Roger interrupted. “Let’s get
this straight. You’ve seen Miss Cross, have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she’s⸺”</p>

<p>“And she’s a remarkably pretty girl, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>Anthony stared. “How the devil did you know that?”</p>

<p>“Merely a simple piece of deductive reasoning,”
replied Roger modestly. “Now then, start at the beginning
and tell me exactly what happened.”</p>

<p>Rather more coherently this time, Anthony complied.
He gave an account of his meeting with the girl, told
how she had broken down (glossing as delicately as
possible over the subsequent proximity of her dark head
and his shoulder) and went on to give his highly
interested listener a detailed synopsis of the story she had
told him in order to spare her the pain of having to
recount it a second time. This recital lasted them almost
to the very spot where she was waiting, and Anthony had
only just time to reiterate in a fierce undertone the
promise he had given that they would do all in their
power to help her and to demand that a similar promise
should be given by Roger himself within the first five
minutes of the interview, before her black dress sprang
into view on the little ledge just below them.</p>

<p>Roger was conducted down the bank and ceremoniously
introduced and the three of them disposed
themselves on the soft turf to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>“Now I want you to understand, Miss Cross,” Roger
said briskly after a few general remarks had been made,
“that my cousin and I are entirely on your side.” Roger
had been as favourably impressed at first sight with
this slender, courageous-looking, proud-spirited girl as
had Anthony, and he was at no pains to attempt to
disguise the fact. “There’s no use pretending that this isn’t
a bad business. It is—more so than you know: and
it may become even worse than that in the very near
future.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Sheringham?” asked the
girl with anxiety. “How more so than I know?”</p>

<p>Roger deliberated. “Well I don’t see that there can
be any harm in telling you,” he said gravely. “You’re
bound to know sooner or later. But please don’t tell
anybody else just yet awhile.—I’m afraid there can be
very little doubt that your cousin’s death was not an
accident.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that—that⸺?” The girl broke
off, white to the lips.</p>

<p>“I’m very much afraid so,” Roger said gently. There
was no need to mention the ugly word ‘murder’; its
implication was sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>“Good God!” Anthony breathed, aghast. “Has that
been definitely proved?”</p>

<p>“As definitely as matters. She wasn’t alone when she
met her death, for one thing, though it isn’t known who
was with her. And there are one or two other details
too into which I needn’t go now, small enough in
themselves but uncommonly convincing in the mass.
Anyhow, you can see that it’s a really bad business. So if I
put one or two questions to you, Miss Cross, you won’t
think me unnecessarily impertinent, will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said the girl earnestly. “And I can’t
tell you how grateful I am for your kindness. But you
won’t—you won’t put too much about me in the <i>Courier</i>,
will you?”</p>

<p>“You can rely on my discretion,” Roger smiled. “I’ll
see that you’re not worried in that sort of way so far
as I’m concerned at any rate; and I’ll drop a word or
two in season to any others of my kidney who follow
me down here. Well now, first of all I want you to tell
me exactly what happened on this walk you had with
your cousin. Can you do that?”</p>

<p>The girl frowned in an effort of memory. “Yes, I
think so. It was quite simple. We walked along the cliffs
about a mile toward Sandsea and then turned round
and came back; just before we got as far as this Elsie
said she wanted to go over and speak to a Mrs. Russell,
a neighbour, about some treat for the village children
that they were getting up between them. She knew this
was a favourite place of mine, so she asked me to wait
for her here, and we could go back to the house for tea
together.”</p>

<p>“One minute,” Roger interrupted. “Where does Mrs.
Russell live?”</p>

<p>“About half-way between our house and the village.”</p>

<p>“I see. So it was really out of her way to come back
and pick you up here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a little; but Elsie always liked walking
along these cliffs. She nearly always went into the village
this way instead of by the road.”</p>

<p>“The road lying on the other side of the house from
here, of course. Then is the Russells’ house on the same
road?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the road winds toward the cliffs farther
along, so it wouldn’t take her so much out of her way
to come back to me here as if it didn’t.”</p>

<p>“No, I see that. Yes?”</p>

<p>“Well, she didn’t come back. I must have waited for
nearly an hour and a half. Then, as it was past
tea-time, I walked over to the house alone.”</p>

<p>“Now, sitting down here, you couldn’t see anybody
walking along the cliff top, or they you, unless they
happened to walk right over the top of this bank at the
back here?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, <em>did</em> anybody pass while you
were here?”</p>

<p>“No, not a soul.”</p>

<p>Roger frowned. “That’s a pity. That means you can’t
actually prove that you were here during that time,
can you?”</p>

<p>“If Miss Cross says she was here,” Anthony put in
warmly, “then she was here. That ought to be good
enough for anyone.”</p>

<p>“Except a court of law, Anthony. Courts of law are
nasty, suspicious things, I’m afraid. By the way, did
Mrs. Vane ever get to the Russells’ house, Miss Cross?”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t; that’s the extraordinary thing. In fact
nobody seems to have seen her at all from the time she
left me to the time her body was found.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nasty gap,” Roger commented thoughtfully.
“Isn’t it rather curious that she should have been about
here all that time without being seen? Aren’t there
usually plenty of people in the neighbourhood?”</p>

<p>“No, as a matter of fact there aren’t. It’s usually
fairly deserted up here. Ours and the Russells’ are the
only two houses out this way, you see. And there’s
another point about that; anybody walking along the edge
of the cliff can’t be seen from the road except in one
or two places, because of the high ground between, if
you remember noticing it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so; you’re right. Hullo, what’s that
bell?”</p>

<p>“That will be our dinner-bell,” said the girl with a
faint smile. “A most efficient one, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Highly. Well, Miss Cross,” Roger said, scrambling
to his feet, “I don’t think there’s any need to keep you
any longer just now, though there are one or two more
things I shall want to ask you. Could you meet us here
at say half-past ten to-morrow morning for more
cross-examination, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Sheringham. I shall be only too
pleased. And you will try to—to⸺”</p>

<p>“To throw a little fresh light on that hour and a
half?” Roger suggested as he shook hands. “I promise
you I will. That’s the crux of the whole thing, isn’t it?
I’ll do all I can, Miss Cross, you can be sure.”</p>

<p>They climbed the little bank and Anthony, by a
curious lapse of memory, appeared to forget that he had
already shaken hands on the lower level; at any rate he
did so again, even more warmly than before.</p>

<p>“It’s a nasty business,” Roger remarked as the two
of them set out on their walk back to the inn. “Nastier
than I let out. I didn’t tell the little lady that the other
person with Mrs. Vane was a woman, by the way.”</p>

<p>“Was she?” said Anthony gloomily. “Hell!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll tell you what I managed to find out down
there. Not much, but decidedly interesting. Mrs. Vane
must have— By jove, I was nearly forgetting!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Something I picked up near where the body was
found—a bit of writing-paper. I haven’t been able to
look at it yet. It may be nothing, but on the other hand
it may be something uncommonly important. Anyhow,
let’s have a look at it.” And digging into his
breast-pocket, Roger drew out his handkerchief and its precious
contents.</p>

<p>“Looks a bit sodden,” Anthony remarked, as the
little ball of bluish-grey paper emerged from its
covering.</p>

<p>“Naturally, as it’s been in the water off and on for
sixty odd hours or so,” said Roger, straightening out the
sodden little tangle with infinite care. It was a ticklish
business, for the least false move would tear the flimsy
stuff and it had to be unwrapped half-an-inch at a time.</p>

<p>“Can you make anything out?” Anthony asked
eagerly, as the sheet was at last laid out flat on the
palm of Roger’s hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit of ordinary notepaper,” Roger murmured,
peering down at it intently. “Good quality. Watermark
a big crown and some kind of inscription. Ought to be
easy enough to trace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but is there any writing on it?”</p>

<p>“There <em>has</em> been, but that’s about as much as one can
say. See these faint pen-marks? But I should think it’s
pretty well impossible to make out what was written on
it.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s no use?” Anthony asked disappointedly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say that. An expert might be able to make
them out. I suppose there <em>are</em> ways of testing this sort
of thing. We’ll see, anyhow. But we mustn’t build any
hopes on it. Ten to one it had nothing to do with Mrs.
Vane at all, and even if it did it’s another ten to one
that it had nothing to do with what we’re after. However,
we’ll take it back and see if it’s possible to do anything
with it.”</p>

<p>Roger took off his hat and laid the paper carefully
inside to shield it from the wind, and they resumed their
journey.</p>

<p>“What did you think of Miss Cross?” Anthony asked
very airily, gazing at the easy feats of a neighbouring
gull with an appearance of intense interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” Roger said with malicious
indifference. “Perfectly ordinary sort of girl, I thought, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Personally, she struck me as being rather an
exceptional one,” Anthony said coldly.</p>

<p>“Did she? Ah, well! Bit long in the nose, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Long in the nose!” exclaimed the indignant
Anthony. “Why, her nose is absolutely⸺” He caught
sight of Roger’s grin and broke off abruptly. “Damn
you!” he growled, flushing vividly.</p>

<p>“Ah, you young people!” Roger continued to grin.
“Ah, youth, happy youth! Ah⸺”</p>

<p>“Roger, you ass, be serious for a minute. Do you
think that girl’s in any danger?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed,” Roger said with a quick change to
gravity. “At least, I don’t know about danger, but I
certainly think she’s in a very awkward position. Very
awkward indeed.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t think—you don’t think there can be
anything in—well, what the inspector seems to be
thinking, do you?”</p>

<p>“You mean, that she pushed her cousin over the
cliff?” amplified Roger, who was not a person to mince
matters. “No, I don’t think I do. I liked her, I must
say—though that isn’t anything to go by, is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a devil of a lot. And you really will do all you
can to help clear her, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will. Haven’t I told her so half-a-dozen
times over?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old man,” said Anthony simply.</p>

<p>It was a slightly awkward moment. To tide it over
Roger embarked upon a voluble account of his
conversation with Inspector Moresby, what he had discovered
and what he had not, which took them right up to the
door of their inn.</p>

<p>“And that’s the first thing we’ve got to discover, fair
coz,” he was saying vehemently as they crossed the
threshold. “What old Moresby’s got up his sleeve. And
that’s what I’m jolly well going to get out of him
somehow, by hook, or even, if it comes to the point, by crook.
And what’s more, I think I see a way of going about it.
So now for our four bedrooms and a little cold water.
By Jove, Anthony, it’s hot isn’t it? What about a
tankard apiece before we go upstairs?”</p>

<p>“How you do think of things!” was Anthony’s
strongly approving comment.</p>

<p>They adjourned briskly into the cool little bar.</p>

<p>“Mr. Moresby back yet, do you know?” Roger asked
the landlord in a casual voice as he set the mighty
tankard down on the counter after an initial gulp at its
contents.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied that mountainous man. “He said
he’d be back for ’is supper round about eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall be ready for ours about that time
too. You might as well serve all three in our
sitting-room. And send me up a bottle of gin, half-a-dozen
bottles of ginger-beer, a bottle of whisky, a couple of
syphons of soda and a corkscrew. Can you manage
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the landlord benevolently. “That I
can.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! I suppose it would be too much to ask if
you’ve got any ice as well?”</p>

<p>“I have an’ all, sir,” replied the landlord with
conscious pride. “I gets it three times a week from
Sandsea in this ’ot weather. There’s some come in this
morning you can have, and welcome.”</p>

<p>“But this is sheer epicureanism!” Roger cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the landlord. “There’s been two gents
in this evening asking for rooms. London gents, by the
look of ’em. I told ’em I ’adn’t got any.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, landlord,” Roger said with approval.
“Speak the truth and shame the devil, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the landlord, and turned away to
serve another customer.</p>

<p>“I say,” Anthony asked hopefully as they climbed the
stairs a few minutes later, “I say, are we going to make
old Moresby tight?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said Roger with dignity. “I’m
surprised at you, Anthony. Do I look the sort of person
to interfere with the sobriety of the police in the
execution of their duty?”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s all that gin and stuff for, then?”</p>

<p>“To pour libations to the great and <i lang="fr">puissante</i> Goddess
of Bluff! Now then, Anthony, how many bedrooms
would you like to sleep in to-night? One, two or three?”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> An Unwelcome Clue</h2>

<p>Inspector Moresby, it has been said, was a
genial man. He had no hesitation in falling in with
Roger’s suggestion that the three of them should sup
together. Even a Scotland Yard detective is human, and
Inspector Moresby very much preferred to spend his
moments of leisure in the congenial company of his
fellows than alone.</p>

<p>In the same way he had no hesitation in accepting a
little gin before a meal. In yet once more the same way
he had not the slightest hesitation in drinking some gin
and ginger-beer with his supper because, as anyone
knows, gin and ginger-beer with a lump of ice clinking
invitingly against the glass is the greatest of all drinks
on a hot day and has the Olympian nectar beaten to a
standstill; thus far has civilisation progressed. And
after a meal when, pleasantly tired and a pleasant
hunger pleasantly allayed, one sprawls in a horsehair
armchair and contemplates a case of stuffed birds, an
iced whisky and soda by one’s side is almost a <i lang="la">sine
qua non</i>. Inspector Moresby <em>was</em> a genial man.</p>

<p>Roger had behaved with exemplary tact. Not a word
about their common mission to Ludmouth had passed
his lips. Instead, he had set out to be as entertaining as
he possibly could; and when Roger set out to be
entertaining he could prove a very good companion indeed.
He had recounted numberless anecdotes about the
humours of his own early struggles and experiences, and
the inspector had been amused; he had recounted
further anecdotes of the great people he had met and
knew, all of whom he called by their Christian names,
and the inspector had been impressed; he had kept a
judicious eye on his victim’s glass—or rather,
succession of glasses, and the inspector had become mellowed.
Roger loved the inspector, and the inspector loved Roger.</p>

<p>Roger chose his moment and struck.</p>

<p>“Look here, Inspector,” he said quite casually, “about
this Mrs. Vane business, by the way. I wish you’d look
on me not as a reporter but as an amateur criminologist,
extraordinarily interested in the way the police go about
the solving of a mystery like this and only too ready to
put any small brains I may have at their assistance. I
do happen to be writing this thing up for a newspaper,
it’s true; but that’s only by the way. I’m not a
reporter by instinct or profession or anything else, and I
only jumped at the chance of becoming one because
it would give me first-hand information about a very
interesting little mystery. Do you see what I mean?”</p>

<p>The inspector’s eyes twinkled. “I think so, sir. You
want me to take you into my confidence, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Something like that,” Roger agreed. “And I must
tell you that the balance won’t be entirely on your side.
I’ve got something rather important to offer you—a
clue I found this afternoon under your very nose down
among those rocks. I don’t want to hold it up or anything
like that; but candidly, I don’t want to give it away
for nothing either. Can’t we arrange a swap, so to
speak?”</p>

<p>The inspector’s eyes twinkled more merrily than ever.
“I’ve been waiting for something like this ever since I
came up here, Mr. Sheringham; though I didn’t expect
you to put it quite that way. I thought you’d just got
me here to try to pump me in the ordinary way, as
hundreds of new journalists have tried already before
they found out it wasn’t any use.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Roger somewhat crestfallen. “Did you?
But about this clue, I⸺”</p>

<p>“Lord, the number of clues I’ve had offered me in my
time!” observed the inspector reminiscently.
“Thousands of ’em! And not a single one worth a twopenny
rap.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Roger again. “Then there’s nothing
doing, I take it, in the confidence line?”</p>

<p>The inspector continued to chuckle for a moment; it
pleased him mildly to score off Roger and he thought
the latter deserved it. Even Anthony, in spite of his
disappointment, could hardly repress a smile at that
confident gentleman’s discomfiture.</p>

<p>Then the inspector proceeded to relent. “However,
I’m not saying there isn’t any sense in what you said.
There is. I know you’re not an ordinary journalist. I
know what you did at Wychford and I’ve seen by your
articles in the <i>Courier</i> that you really are interested in
this sort of thing for its own sake. So as long as I have
your word that you won’t publish anything that I want
held up, perhaps I don’t mind letting you in on a thing
or two that I should keep back from anyone else, and
even talking the case over with you as well. Though
mind you, it’s highly unprofessional conduct, as they
say, and I should get into real hot water at the Yard
if they ever came to hear of it.”</p>

<p>“I say, that’s awfully sporting of you, Inspector!”
Roger cried with vast relief. “I quite thought you were
going to turn me down. Yes, I promise you the Yard
shan’t hear of it, and of course I won’t publish
anything without your consent. It’s a purely personal
interest, you know.”</p>

<p>“And you too, Mr. Walton? You agree to that?”</p>

<p>“Rather, Inspector! It’s extraordinarily decent of
you.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s hear about this clue of yours first of
all, Mr. Sheringham, if you please.”</p>

<p>Roger rose and went to the sideboard, from a drawer
of which he produced the piece of paper, now almost
dry. “I found this a couple of rocks away from where
the body was lying. It may have nothing to do with the
affair at all, of course, but there’s always a chance.
There’s been writing on it, but it’s quite obliterated.
Can you make anything of it?”</p>

<p>The inspector took the bit of paper and bent over it;
then he held it up to the light.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep this, if I may,” he said. “As you say,
there’s probably nothing in it, but I’ll send it up to
our man at the Yard and I think he’ll be able to read
it all right; at any rate, we can’t afford to neglect its
possibilities.” He laid the paper down on a table
nearby and leaned comfortably back in his chair again.
“So now you can fire away, Mr. Sheringham. I know
you’ve got half a hundred questions on the tip of your
tongue.”</p>

<p>“At least that,” Roger laughed, as he resumed his
seat. “And I certainly would like to polish off a few of
them in rather a hurry. I must get through to London
on the telephone pretty soon and dictate my article, and
I can take notes for it as we go along.” He rummaged
in a side-pocket and produced a pencil and note-book.
“Now first of all, are you sure in your own mind that
it’s a case of murder and not accident or suicide?”</p>

<p>“Well, between ourselves, sir, I am. As sure, that is,
as anyone can be in my line without absolutely
convincing proof. But don’t say that in your article. I
shouldn’t get further than ‘suspicious circumstances’ in
that yet awhile.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded. “Yes, I quite see that. By the way,
that scream rather clinches it, doesn’t it? I mean, if one
allows that the distance of the body from the edge of
the cliffs rules out any question of accident, the scream,
equally seems to rule out suicide. A suicide wouldn’t
scream.”</p>

<p>“That was my line of thought exactly,” the inspector
agreed.</p>

<p>“And you’ve also established the fact that she wasn’t
alone. Have you got any ideas who the second woman
was?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got my suspicions,” said the inspector
guardedly. “I was up at the house for a goodish bit this
morning,” he went on, delicately shifting the ground of
discussion. “Have you been along there?”</p>

<p>“No, not to the house, though I heard you had.”</p>

<p>“You ought to go; I think you’d find it interesting.
The household, I mean.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, I haven’t felt quite hardened
enough to my new profession yet. I don’t think I could
butt in on Dr. Vane and ask him for an interview just
at present. Can’t you tell me about them and save me
the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Well, I daresay I could. There’s not really much
to tell you. But the doctor’s a queer stick. Big man, he
is, with a great black beard, and spends most of his
time in a laboratory he’s had fitted up at the back
of the house. Research work of some kind. Bit brusque
in his manner, if you understand me, and doesn’t seem
any too cut up by his wife’s death—or doesn’t show
it if he is, perhaps I ought to say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“But I gather that the two of them didn’t hit it off
any too well together. That seemed the idea among the
servants, anyhow. I had all of them up and questioned
them this morning, of course. Then there’s his
secretary, a dry stick of a woman with pince-nez and short
hair, who might be any age between thirty and fifty,
and a cousin of Mrs. Vane’s who’s been living there
for the last few months called Miss Cross. That’s the
girl who’s come into all the money, as I expect you’ve
heard.”</p>

<p>“And the girl who was the last person apparently
except one to see Mrs. Vane alive,” Roger nodded. “Yes,
I’ve seen her, had a chat with her in fact.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have, have you? And what did you think of
her, Mr. Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Roger hedged. “What did you?”</p>

<p>The inspector considered. “I thought she was quite a
nice young lady,” he said carefully, “though perhaps a
bit deeper than one might think—or than she’d like you
to think, maybe. Did you get any information from her?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Inspector,” Anthony burst out suddenly,
“just tell me this, will you? Do you really honestly think
that⸺”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Anthony, and don’t be tactless!” Roger
interposed hastily. “Did I get any information out of her,
Inspector? Nothing more than you got yourself, I fancy.
She told me that you’d been putting her through it.”</p>

<p>“She’s a very important person in the case,” said the
inspector with an apologetic air. “Last one to see Mrs.
Vane alive, as you said just now.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that exactly,” Roger remarked drily;
“but let it pass. And you got no further impression from
her than that she was a nice young lady and might be a
bit deep?”</p>

<p>“Well I didn’t say that, sir,” ruminated the inspector.
“No, I wouldn’t say that at all. I got the impression
that she wasn’t over-fond of that cousin of hers, for one
thing.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t fond of her cousin?” Roger cried in surprise.
“But Mrs. Vane had been extraordinarily kind to her.
Taken her to live with them, paid her a generous salary
probably for doing nothing, made a will in her favour!
Why, she owed Mrs. Vane a tremendous lot!”</p>

<p>“Are we always over-fond of people we owe a
tremendous lot to?” asked the inspector pointedly.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” Anthony began stiffly, “that Miss
Cross⸺”</p>

<p>“Shut <em>up</em>, Anthony!—But why are you so sure about
this, Inspector? You must have something more to go
on than just an impression.”</p>

<p>“I have, sir. What I learned from the servants. Mrs.
Vane and Miss Cross used to quarrel quite a lot, I
understand. It seems to have been a matter of common
talk among the servants.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if you take any notice of the gossip of
servants,” said Anthony with fine scorn, “I daresay
you’d⸺”</p>

<p>“Anthony, <em>will</em> you shut up or have I got to send you
to bed? For goodness’ sake, help yourself to another
drink and keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen Miss Cross too, Mr. Walton, I take it?”
observed the inspector mildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” Anthony said shortly.</p>

<p>“A very pretty young lady,” commented the inspector
with vague application.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way!” Roger exclaimed suddenly. “I was
very nearly forgetting the most important question of
all.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that, Mr. Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“Why, to ask you what you’ve got up your sleeve in
the way of clues. You admitted this afternoon there were
some things you wouldn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“One,” acknowledged the inspector with a smile.
“That’s all. A coat-button.” He felt in his pocket and
produced a light-blue bone button with a white pattern,
about an inch and a half in diameter, which he held
out on the flat of his palm. “This was found clenched
in the dead woman’s hand.”</p>

<p>Roger whistled softly. “I say, that is a clue and no
mistake! The first really definite one there’s been,
except those footprints. May I have a look at it?” He took
the button from the other’s outstretched hand and
examined it intently. “It wasn’t one of her own, by any
chance?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Have you found out whose it is?” Roger asked,
looking up quickly.</p>

<p>“I have,” replied the inspector contentedly.</p>

<p>Anthony’s heart almost stopped beating. “Whose?” he
asked in a strained voice.</p>

<p>“It’s a button off a sports-coat belonging to Miss
Cross.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was a tense silence. Then Roger
asked the question that was burning a hole in his brain.</p>

<p>“Was Miss Cross wearing the coat when she went out
for her walk with Mrs. Vane?”</p>

<p>“She was, sir,” replied the inspector with a more
serious air than he had yet displayed. “And when she
got back to the house that button was missing from it.”</p>

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> Sidelights on a Loathsome Lady</h2>

<p>“I tell you I don’t <em>care!</em>” Anthony almost
shouted. “To say that girl had anything to do with the
wretched woman’s death is too damned silly for words!”</p>

<p>“But I’m not saying so,” Roger pointed out patiently.
“I don’t think she had, in spite of everything. What I
am saying is that we can’t dismiss the possibility of it
in this cocksure way just because she’s got a pretty face.
The inspector isn’t⸺”</p>

<p>“Blast the inspector!” observed Anthony savagely.</p>

<p>“Blast him by all means, but, as I was saying, he
isn’t by any means a fool, and it’s quite obvious what
his opinion about Mrs. Vane’s death is at present. After
all, you must face the fact that the evidence is absolutely
overwhelming.”</p>

<p>“If his opinion is that Miss Cross murdered her
cousin, then he <em>is</em> a fool,” growled Anthony finally; “and
a damned fool at that.”</p>

<p>It was the following morning, and the two men were
walking along the top of the cliffs to keep their
appointment with Margaret Cross. The inspector had betaken
himself to bed on the previous evening soon after the
bursting of his bombshell, and the discussion between
Anthony and Roger had lasted well into the small hours
of the morning, broken only by an interval of
half-an-hour while Roger telephoned through to the <i>Courier</i>.
It was still raging.</p>

<p>Anthony had refused point-blank to consider even
the possibility that Margaret had not spoken the exact
truth in every detail or had wilfully suppressed any
material fact, while as for the only logical deduction
to be drawn from the facts as they were then known,
he would rather have been torn in pieces by red-hot
pincers than admit it within the category of bare
feasibilities. To Roger, who was no less anxious that
the girl’s name should be cleared, but had a livelier
conception of the difficulties in the way of doing so,
this attitude was a little trying. To Anthony’s final
remark he forbore to reply, only sighing gently to
himself. It required an effort of will, but no good purpose
would be served by quarrelling with Anthony, and
Anthony was very ready to quarrel with someone. They
traversed the rest of the journey in difficult silence.</p>

<p>Margaret Cross was waiting for them by the little
ledge, her face anxious and bearing the marks of a
sleepless night.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad to see you!” she exclaimed as she
shook hands with Roger. “Really I feel as if you were
the only friend I’d got in the world.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget me, Miss Cross,” Anthony smiled,
shaking hands with her in his turn.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” said the girl in a voice that was
neither enthusiastic nor chilling—just indifferent; and
she snatched away the hand that Anthony was manifestly
attempting to press and, turning ostentatiously back to
Roger, began to question him eagerly as to whether
anything fresh had transpired.</p>

<p>Over Anthony’s face passed an expression such as
might have been seen on the face of a dog which has
put out a paw to toy with a fly and discovered it to be
a wasp—hurt and yet puzzled. As Margaret Cross
continued to display to him only her back the puzzled part
of his expression gave way to resentment; as she made
no effort to include him in her eager conversation, but
on the contrary quite pointedly ignored him, resentment
and chagrin alike were swallowed up by sheer
annoyance. As ostentatiously as herself, he strolled a few paces
away and began to amuse himself by throwing stones
over the edge of the cliff. Anthony was sulking.</p>

<p>Had he been a little wiser, he might have felt flattered.
As it was, how could he be expected to guess that to a
young lady who is accustomed to pride herself not a
little on her self-reliance and strength of mind, the
thought of having been such a sloppy little idiot as to
weep on the shoulder of a complete stranger and actually
grovel before the protective feel of his unknown arm
about her, might possibly be a singularly ignominious
one? In which case, of course (so the older and wiser
Anthony might have complacently assumed), her
resentment, directed naturally against himself as the witness
of her humiliation, would be only complimentary. But
Anthony was neither older nor wiser.</p>

<p>“I say, Anthony, come and listen to this!” called
Roger, who had a shrewd idea of the way in which the
wind was blowing.</p>

<p>Very nonchalantly Anthony strolled across. “Yes?”
he said in a voice that was neither rude nor
frigid—just bored.</p>

<p>“I’ve been telling Miss Cross about the coat-button.
It may not be quite playing the game with the inspector,
but I really think it’s only fair that she should know.”
He turned to the girl. “And you say you must have lost
it on that walk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must have lost it on the walk,” the girl said
in puzzled tones, “but where, I haven’t the least idea.
All I know is that it was on when I started, and I noticed
that it was off when I got back. It might have dropped
simply anywhere. How it got into Elsie’s hand I can’t
imagine. Mightn’t she have picked it up and been
meaning to give it back to me?”</p>

<p>“That does seem the only possible explanation,”
Roger agreed. He did not think it necessary for the
moment to point out that as Mrs. Vane’s subsequent steps
would hardly have covered any of the ground that she
and Margaret had passed over together, the explanation
was not very probable.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Sheringham, I do wish I could get away
from this dreadful atmosphere of suspicion!” cried the
girl suddenly, her strained nerves overcoming for the
moment her self-control. “It’s really getting almost
unbearable! Every fresh fact that comes to light only
makes it worse. I shall really begin to think of
jumping over the cliff myself if something doesn’t happen
soon. And they’re evidently beginning to talk in the
village already. Mrs. Russell cut me dead outside her
own house this morning.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Russell!” Roger murmured. “Wouldn’t
I like to flay the hag. Christian charity, I suppose she
calls that. But look here, don’t you give way before any
nonsense like that, Margaret, my dear.” Roger
invariably addressed every unmarried lady below the age of
thirty by her Christian name after the briefest possible
acquaintance, it accorded with his reputation for mild
Bohemianism, and it saved an awful lot of trouble.
“We’re going to see you through this, Cousin Anthony
and I. So keep your chin up and let all the old cats
go to the devil!”</p>

<p>Margaret turned away for a moment, biting her lip.
“I don’t know how to thank you,” she said in rather a
shaky voice. “I really can’t think what I should have
done if I hadn’t met you two, Mr. Sheringham.”</p>

<p>“Roger!” exclaimed Roger briskly. “For Heaven’s
sake do call me Roger, Margaret! Only people who owe
me money call me ‘Mr. Sheringham.’ It has a nasty,
sinister sound.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” the girl smiled. “Thank
you—Roger!”</p>

<p>Roger drew a breath of relief as he saw the threatened
tears disappear before his calculated nonsense. “And
this is Anthony,” he went on with mock seriousness.
“Let me introduce you. Anthony, Margaret. Margaret,
Anthony. Now shake hands and tell each other what
a lovely day it is.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, Anthony?” Margaret said gravely,
a little smile dancing in her brown eyes; and somehow
she managed to convey the impression that she was
sorry for having made a pig of herself ten minutes
before, that this was her apology and that would he please
forgive her?</p>

<p>“How do you do, Margaret?” said Anthony, taking
the slim fingers in his great paw; and the slight pressure
he gave them said perfectly plainly that it wasn’t his
place to forgive anything; wouldn’t she rather forgive
him instead for sulking in that childish way, for which
he was heartily sorry?</p>

<p>So that was all right.</p>

<p>“Why stand up when we can sit down?” Roger
remarked, observing the results of his tactfulness with some
satisfaction; and he set a good example by throwing
himself at full length on the springy turf. The others
followed suit.</p>

<p>“Now what we’ve got to do,” he went on, lying on his
back and puffing hard at his pipe, “is to form an
offensive and defensive alliance of three. Your job, Margaret,
will be to get us any information we want about the
household and so on, and mine to put that information
to the most advantageous use.”</p>

<p>“What about Anthony?” asked Margaret.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s the idiot friend. He came down on purpose
to be it. We mustn’t do him out of that, or he’d be
awfully disappointed.”</p>

<p>“Poor Anthony!” Margaret laughed. “Roger, I think
you’re horrid.”</p>

<p>“Not horrid,” Anthony said lazily. “Just an ass. But
pretend not to notice it, Margaret. We always try to
ignore it in the family.”</p>

<p>“Reverting to the topic in hand,” Roger observed,
unperturbed, “there’s one thing that I really must impress
on both of you. Rather a nasty thing, but we’ve got to
face it. From the facts as we know them at present,
there’s simply only one deduction to be drawn; if we
want new deductions, we must have new facts.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean,” Margaret said slowly. “Yes,
and I see that it’s quite true too. But how on earth are
we to get any new facts?”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see if a little judicious questioning will
bring anything to light.” Roger paused for a moment
as if considering. “I suppose you were very fond of your
cousin, Margaret?” he said after a second or two in an
almost careless voice.</p>

<p>It was Margaret’s turn to pause and consider. Then:
“No!” she said almost harshly. “I don’t see why I
shouldn’t tell you, though I realise that it doesn’t make
my position any better. I detested her!”</p>

<p>“You detested her?” Roger repeated, raising himself
on his elbow to look at her in his astonishment. “But
I thought she’d been so kind to you? I thought she was
such a charming woman?”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed bitterly. “Quite a number of people
think that. Elsie took good care that they should. Isn’t
there a saying about speaking only good of the dead?
Well, I never have been a conventional person. Elsie
was one of the most loathsome people who can ever have
existed!”</p>

<p>“Oho!” said Roger softly. “She was, was she? Talk
about new facts! This looks like opening up a whole new
field of enquiry. Perpend, lady! Why was Elsie ‘one of
the most loathsome people who can ever have existed’?”</p>

<p>“It is rather a sweeping charge, isn’t it?” said
Margaret soberly. “Well, I’ll tell you the whole story and
you can judge for yourself. When Elsie met George she
was in rather the same position as I was in myself a few
months ago—broke to the wide. But she didn’t let him
know that. She pretended to belong to a good family
and to have plenty of money of her own. In fact, she
deliberately set out to deceive him. George believed
every word she said, fell in love with her and married
her—which, of course, was what she’d been aiming at.”</p>

<p>“You mean she married Dr. Vane for his money?”</p>

<p>“Purely and simply! I know, because she used to
boast of it to me, and advise me to do the same. Boast
of it! How she’d taken him in and hoodwinked him from
beginning to end. She got a tremendous marriage
settlement out of him, too. All the money she left me. Ten
thousand pounds settled on her absolutely. Of course she
hadn’t a penny of her own. She often used to tell me
how well she’d done for herself. Oh, Elsie was a true
daughter of her grandfather—<em>our</em> grandfather, I should
say!”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Roger thoughtfully. “Yes, that does shed
a somewhat different light on the lady. And she took you
to live with her so that you could have the chance of
meeting another wealthy man and hoodwinking him
similarly?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she didn’t! That’s what she used to tell me,
but nothing could be further from the truth. The fact
is that there were several reasons why she wanted me
with her. In the first place, she wanted someone whom
she could order about in a way that no servant would
stand for a minute, someone who would do things for
her that she would never have dared to ask any servant
to do. Oh, Roger, you can’t imagine the things I’ve had
to do since I came here! Menial things that she couldn’t
have made anybody else in the world do for her. And
yet nothing outrageous, if you understand—nothing that
I could flare up at and flounce out of the house over.
Oh, it’s extraordinarily difficult to explain. You see, you
probably haven’t any idea what a beast one woman
can be to another in a subordinate position without
ever doing anything that you could actually call
<em>beastly</em>.”</p>

<p>“I think I have, though, for all that,” Roger
murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>Margaret knitted her brows. “Well, suppose we’d been
out for a walk together in the rain and come in rather
tired and rather wet and rather muddy. The first thing
she’d do would be to send me upstairs with her wet coat
and hat and tell me to bring down a pair of dry shoes. I
should go down and find her sprawling in a chair in the
drawing-room in front of the fire, but otherwise just as
I’d left her. She’d want me to change her shoes for her,
probably even pull her gloves off for her as well. Then
she’d find out that her stockings were wet too, and I
should be sent to get a dry pair—and probably change
those for her as well. Then she’d decide she didn’t like
those shoes with those stockings, and off I’d have to go
to get another pair. As soon as I’d done that, I’d be sent
up again for something else that she’d pretend to have
forgotten all about, and then for something more after
that. In other words, she kept me on the go the whole
time: I was hardly ever allowed to have a single second
to myself.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded understandingly. “I know the type.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was one thing she wanted me for. Another
was that she was a horrid little bully, and she must have
someone to bully. You can’t bully servants; they give
notice. There’s nobody like a poor relation for bullying.
And all with a sweet smile you know, that seemed to
make it even more unbearable if anything.”</p>

<p>“But why did you stick it?” Anthony asked
indignantly.</p>

<p>Margaret flushed slightly. “Because I was a coward,
I suppose. I’d had about enough of roughing it by then,
and I <em>was</em> comfortable at any rate. Besides, there was
that ten thousand pounds she was dangling over me. If
you’d ever known what it’s like not to be able to afford
a penny bun or a cup of tea, you might realise what
a tempting bait ten thousand pounds can be and what
a lot you’ll put up with to qualify for it. Very mercenary,
isn’t it? But Elsie knew all right. She’d been through it
herself.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Margaret,” Anthony said in some
confusion. “I was an ass to say a thing like that. Of course
I understand.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” Margaret went on more calmly,
“I <em>was</em> going to cut and run for it. I’d discovered the
game wasn’t worth the candle after all. But I hadn’t
fixed any date or made up my mind what to put my hand
to next, and then—and then <em>this</em> happened.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>“Can you give me a few more details about your
cousin?” suddenly asked Roger, who seemed to have
been pursuing a train of thought of his own. “A little
bit more about her character, and what she looked like,
and all that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>Margaret considered. “Well, she was little and fragile
to look at, with rather a babyish face, fair hair, and a
slight lisp which she cultivated rather carefully. She
used to pose as the helpless, appealing little woman,
though anybody less helpless than Elsie, so far as her
own interests were concerned, I’ve never met. Her idea
(as she told me perfectly frankly) was that men liked
the helpless, appealing type; and judging by results, she
wasn’t far wrong. As for her character, I don’t see what
else there is to tell you. She was a hypocrite, a bully,
utterly selfish, mean, and bad all through.” Margaret
gazed out to sea, breathing heavily, her cheeks flushed.
Evidently she was calling to mind some of the
humiliations and unkindnesses she had suffered at the dead
woman’s hands. Anthony watched her with deepening
indignation.</p>

<p>“Did her husband know her real character?” Roger
asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Margaret removed her eyes from the horizon and
began to pluck with aimless fingers at the turf by her side.
“I don’t know!” she said slowly, after a momentary
hesitation. “As a matter of fact I’ve often wondered that.
Sometimes I think he must have, and sometimes I’m
quite sure he didn’t. Elsie was clever, you see. I don’t
suppose she showed her real self to anybody but me.
And I shouldn’t say that George was very observant. He
was always perfectly courteous to her.”</p>

<p>“Is he very upset about her death?”</p>

<p>“Outwardly, not a bit; but what he’s feeling inside
him I haven’t the least idea. George never shows his
feelings. He might be made of stone for all the emotion
he ever displays. Besides, he spends nearly all his time
shut up in his laboratory, just as he always has all the
time I’ve been here.”</p>

<p>“You can’t say whether they got on well together,
then?”</p>

<p>“Not a word! All I can tell you is that he was always
courteous to her, and she⸺” Margaret uttered a
cynical laugh. “Well, it was going to pay her to keep on good
terms with him, so I’ve no doubt she did.”</p>

<p>“I see. There’s nothing further you can tell me about
her?”</p>

<p>“Well, there is one thing,” the girl said a little
doubtfully, “but it’s so very vague that I’m not sure whether
I ought to mention it. It’s this. I couldn’t help feeling
once or twice that there was somebody Elsie was <em>afraid</em>
of.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of? Hullo, that’s interesting! Who?”</p>

<p>“That I haven’t the least idea. In fact the whole thing
is quite probably moonshine. I’ve really got nothing
definite to go on at all. It’s just a sort of impression I
formed.”</p>

<p>“Well, impressions are often valuable. And you can’t
say anything more definite than that?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t. Probably I ought not to have
mentioned it at all, but it might give you a line of
enquiry perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I should think so. That’s just the kind of thing I want
to know.” Roger plucked a handful or two of grass and
scattered them over the edge of the cliff. “Margaret,”
he said suddenly, “what’s your opinion about it all?
Your perfectly private, not-for-publication opinion?”</p>

<p>“I think there’s a great deal more in it than meets
the eye,” said the girl without hesitation.</p>

<p>“So do I, by Jove!” Anthony concurred.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s no doubt about that,” Roger said
thoughtfully. “But it’s all so infernally vague. If one could
only get hold of a definite thread to follow up, however
tiny! You’ve widened the area of enquiry enormously
with what you’ve told us about your cousin, but even
now we’re quite in the dark. All we know is that, instead
of nobody having a grudge against her, any number of
people might. Isn’t there one single definite pointer you
can get hold of for us? Somebody might have a cause
for hating her, say, or a reason for wanting her out of the
way. Rack your brains!”</p>

<p>Margaret racked them obediently and for some
minutes there was silence, broken only by the cries of the
swooping gulls and the splash of the waves against the
rocks at the bottom of the cliffs.</p>

<p>“There’s only one person I can think of who had
cause for hating Elsie,” she said slowly at last. “Or
rather, <em>did</em> hate her, I’m quite certain—whether with
cause or without, I don’t know. Mrs. Russell!”</p>

<p>Roger popped up on his elbow. “Mrs. Russell?” he
repeated eagerly. “Why did she hate Mrs. Vane?”</p>

<p>“She had an idea that Elsie and Mr. Russell were a
little too friendly. A good deal too friendly, not to mince
matters!”</p>

<p>“Oho! The plot thickens. And were they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They were very friendly, certainly.
Whether they were <em>too</em> friendly, I can’t say.”</p>

<p>“But it’s possible?”</p>

<p>“Quite—as far as Elsie is concerned. She had neither
morals nor scruples.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Russell? What sort of a man is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, jolly and red-faced and beefy, you know. The
sort of man you see in those old hunting prints.”</p>

<p>“Just the sort to whom her type might appeal, in fact.
So I should imagine it was quite possible as far as he
was concerned too, eh?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p>Roger smote the turf with an enthusiastic fist. “By
Jove, Margaret, I believe you’ve hit on something here.
Mrs. Russell was simply eaten up with jealousy, of
course. And there’s no motive like jealousy!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we getting on a little too fast?” asked the
girl dubiously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Now tell me—what sort of a woman is
this Mrs. Russell?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s rather fat too; very downright and
decided. A lot of people would call her rude, but I rather
liked her. Not at all good-looking now, though she may
have been once. Pince-nez, hair going a little grey, about
forty-five years old, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“In other words, exactly the sort of woman to be
furiously jealous of a young and pretty one throwing
sheep’s eyes at her husband!” Roger summed up, not
without satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I say!” Anthony exclaimed excitedly. “You said
she was big, didn’t you? Has she got rather large feet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fancy she has. Why?”</p>

<p>The two men exchanged significant glances. Then
Roger sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Anthony! You mean that second lot
of footprints, don’t you? Well, good-bye, my children.
Amuse each other till lunch-time.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Roger?” cried Margaret.</p>

<p>“To look into this matter of the lady with the large
feet and the jealous disposition,” Roger called back,
disappearing at full speed over the bank.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> Introducing a Goat-faced Clergyman</h2>

<p>Roger had no definite plan in his mind as he
walked with quick strides along the cliff-top in the
direction of Ludmouth. His impulsive flight from the other
two had been dictated by two instinctive feelings—that
he wanted to be alone to ponder over the significance of
this fresh information, and that Anthony and Margaret
would probably be not at all averse to a little dose of
each other’s undiluted company. His first idea, equally
instinctive, had been to make a bee-line for the Russells’
house and pour out a torrent of eager questions into
the lady’s astonished ears. Second thoughts warned him
against any such precipitation. He sat down on a
convenient little hummock facing the sea, pulled out and
re-lit his pipe and began to think.</p>

<p>It did not take him many minutes to see that, if this
new lane of enquiry were not to prove a blind alley,
there were two questions of paramount importance first
requiring a satisfactory answer. Of these one was
concerned with Mrs. Russell’s shoes: did they fit the second
lot of footprints in that patch of mud on the cliff-path,
or not? If they did, that did not actually prove
anything, but Mrs. Russell remained a suspected person;
if they did not, then she must be exonerated at once.
The second, and far more important, was this—who
had been at the Russells’ house during the time when
Mrs. Vane might have been expected to call?</p>

<p>Roger was still considering the interesting possibility
depending on the answer to this question, when a gentle
voice behind him cut abruptly into his reverie.</p>

<p>“A charming view from this point, sir, is it not?”
observed the gentle voice.</p>

<p>Roger turned about. A little elderly clergyman, with
silvery hair and a face like a benign but beardless goat,
was peering at him benevolently through a large pair of
horn spectacles. “Oh, Lord, the local parson!” Roger
groaned to himself—not because he disliked parsons,
local or otherwise, but because parsons are inclined to
talk and Roger, at that particular moment in his
existence, surprisingly enough was not. Aloud he said,
courteously enough, “It is indeed; particularly charming.”</p>

<p>The little old parson continued to beam, the sunlight
glittering on his huge spectacles. He did not go nor did
he very definitely stay—he hovered.</p>

<p>“He’s going to talk,” Roger groaned to himself again.
“He wants to talk. He’s aching to talk—I know he is! My
pipe to the Coliseum he’s going to talk!”</p>

<p>Roger’s deduction was not amiss. It was only too
plain that the little old clergyman had every intention
of talking. He had, to be accurate, on seeing Roger’s
back in the distance, come nearly a quarter-of-a-mile out
of his way for the express purpose of talking. He began
to talk.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember seeing you in our little village.
Perhaps you have walked over from Sandsea?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Roger patiently. “I’m staying in
Ludmouth.”</p>

<p>“Ah! At Mrs. Jameson’s, no doubt? I did hear that
she was expecting a visitor.”</p>

<p>“No, at the Crown.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh, dear me! Surely I am not talking to Mr.
Roger Sheringham, am I?” twittered the little
clergyman.</p>

<p>“That is my name, sir, yes,” Roger admitted, with a
mental side-note upon village gossip, its velocity and
the surprising quarters it reaches.</p>

<p>“My dear sir!” The little parson’s beam grew
brighter than ever. “You must permit me to shake hands
with you. No, really you must! This is indeed a
gratifying moment. I have read all your books, every one;
and I cannot tell you how I enjoyed them. Well, fancy,
now!”</p>

<p>Roger was never in the least embarrassed by this kind
of encounter. He shook hands with his admirer with the
greatest heartiness.</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you to say so,” he smiled. “Very
kind indeed. I won’t pretend I’m not gratified. Any
author who pretends to be indifferent to appreciation of
his books is a hypocrite and a liar and an anointed ass.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” agreed the little clergyman in some
bewilderment. “Quite so, no doubt. Well, well, well!”</p>

<p>“How did you know I was staying at the Crown, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, these things get about in a little community like
ours, Mr. Sheringham; very rapidly indeed, if I may
say so. And having read your books, to say nothing of
your recent articles in the <i>Courier</i>, including even this
morning’s⸺ Ah, a sad business that brings you down
here, Mr. Sheringham! Very sad indeed! Dear me, poor
lady, poor lady!”</p>

<p>Roger’s annoyance at the interruption to his thoughts,
already considerably lessened, vanished completely.
If this garrulous old man had anything of interest to
tell, without doubt he could be induced to tell it.
Perhaps the encounter could be turned to good account; in
any case it would be no bad thing to be <i lang="la">persona grata</i>
with the vicar. He indicated with the stem of his pipe
the hummock on which he had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down, sir?” he asked with a fittingly
serious face. “Yes, indeed it is; extraordinarily sad.”</p>

<p>The little clergyman seated himself with a nod of
gratitude and Roger dropped on to the warm turf by his
side.</p>

<p>“Do you know, there is a most distressing rumour
going about in the village, I understand,” remarked
the former deprecatingly, but none the less gossipingly.
“Something about foul play. That is nothing new, of
course; your article this morning hinted quite plainly
at it. But they have got to the stage in the village of
importing actual names into their suspicions. Do you
know that? Most regrettable; <em>most</em> regrettable.”</p>

<p>“It’s what you’d expect, isn’t it?” said Roger a trifle
shortly; he had stayed to pump the other, not to be
pumped himself. “What name or names have they
imported?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Sheringham,” the parson hesitated, “I’m
not sure whether I ought⸺”</p>

<p>“I’ve only got to walk into the bar at the Crown and
ask the nearest loafer, if you don’t wish to tell me,”
Roger pointed out with an air of indifference.</p>

<p>“That is true. Yes, that is very true, I’m afraid. Yes,
I fear you have. Well, perhaps in that case⸺ Well,
they are talking about Miss Cross, you know; Mrs.
Vane’s cousin. Most regrettable; <em>most</em> regrettable!
Surely <em>you</em> don’t think, Mr. Sheringham, that⸺”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” Roger interrupted brusquely,
forestalling the unwelcome question. “Most regrettable!
But surely you, as their vicar, could⸺?” He broke
off meaningly.</p>

<p>The little clergyman looked at him in surprise. “Me?”
he said innocently. “Oh, but you are making a mistake. <em>I</em>
am not the vicar here. Oh, dear, no! Meadows, my
name is: Samuel Meadows. Wait a moment; I have
a card somewhere.” He began to fumble violently in
all his pockets. “Oh, dear, no; I am not the vicar. I have
retired into private life. A small legacy, you understand.
Just a resident here, that is all; and of only a few weeks’
standing. Oh, dear, no; my parish was in Yorkshire.
But Ludmouth is so— Ah, here we are!” With an air of
mild triumph he produced a card from the pocket which
he had first searched, and held it out to Roger. “Perhaps
if you were passing one day—? I should be extremely
honoured.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you indeed,” said Roger politely, his
interest in the little cleric now completely evaporated. He
struggled to his feet. “Well, I must be getting along.”</p>

<p>“You are going back to Ludmouth?” queried the other
with gentle eagerness, rising also. “So am I. We might
perhaps walk in together.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m going the other way,” returned
Roger firmly. “Good morning, Mr. Meadows. See you
again soon, I expect.” And he set briskly off in the
direction of Sandsea.</p>

<p>Behind the first undulation he took cover and watched
his late interlocutor make for the road and pass slowly
out of sight. Then he came out of hiding and walked
rapidly over to the little house which lay half-way
between that of Dr. Vane and the village—the house which
sheltered the frivolous Mr. Russell and his jealous lady.</p>

<p>A perfectly respectable parlour maid answered his
ring and looked at him enquiringly.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Russell in?” Roger asked. “I should like to
speak to her for a moment.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I’m afraid she isn’t. And Mr. Russell is out
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s a nuisance.” Roger rubbed his chin a
moment in thought; then he came to a sudden decision.
“You read the <i>Courier</i> sometimes I expect, don’t you?”
he asked unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the maid in a puzzled voice. “Cook
takes it in, she does.”</p>

<p>“She does, does she? Good for Cook! Well, look
here, I’ve come down to Ludmouth specially for
the <i>Courier</i>, to send them news about that accident you had
here the other day.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face cleared. “Mrs. Vane? Oh, yes, sir!
Then you’re a—a reporting gentleman, sir?”</p>

<p>“A reporting gentleman!” Roger laughed. “Yes,
rather; that describes me to a T. Well, now,” he went
on very confidentially, “the fact of the matter is this.
I ran along to ask Mrs. Russell one or two questions,
and I’m in too much of a hurry to wait for her. Now,
do you think you could answer them for me instead?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” fluttered the maid. “I think I could.
What would it be that you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, now; Mrs. Vane was coming here that
afternoon, wasn’t she? And she never came. Now, I suppose
you were in all the afternoon yourself, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Me, sir? Oh, no. I was on my holidays. I only got
back yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I see. Rotten, coming back to work again, isn’t it?
But the cook would have been in, of course?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; she was out too. It was her afternoon off.
There was nobody in that afternoon but Mrs. Russell
herself.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” observed Roger all to himself. Aloud he said
mechanically, “I see,” and began to rack his brains
furiously for a tactful way of getting hold of a pair of
Mrs. Russell’s shoes. It was not an easy problem.</p>

<p>Usually a problem tended to lose its interest for Roger
if it were too easy, but for this one the time-limit was
not sufficient. On the spur of the moment he could only
see one thing to do, so he did it.</p>

<p>“Can you lend me a pair of Mrs. Russell’s shoes for
an hour or so?” he asked blandly.</p>

<p>“Her <em>shoes?</em>” repeated the astonished maid.</p>

<p>“Yes; any pair of outdoor ones. I’ll let you have them
back before she notices they’re gone.” And he jingled
significantly the loose silver in his trouser-pocket.</p>

<p>“Not—not <em>foot-prints?</em>” twittered the maid, thrilled
to the bone.</p>

<p>Roger made up his mind in a flash. After all, why not
tell the truth? There was no doubt that the maid would
appreciate it, and a spy in the enemy’s camp might be
useful.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he nodded. “But keep this to yourself, mind.
Don’t tell a soul!”</p>

<p>“Not even Cook?” breathed the excited girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can tell Cook,” conceded Roger gravely,
knowing the paramount necessity of permitting a
safety-valve. “But you’ll be responsible for it going no further.
Promise?”</p>

<p>“Oo, yes, sir! I promise.”</p>

<p>“Well, cut up and get me a pair of her shoes, then.”</p>

<p>The girl needed no second invitation. She cut.</p>

<p>In less than a minute she was back again. “Here you
are, sir. I put a bit of newspaper round them, so as
nobody could see what you’re carrying. But you’ll bring
them back, won’t you, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; some time this afternoon. In fact, I’ll tell
you what I’ll do. I’ll bring them to the back-door. How
about that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that would be better, sir. Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And if anybody else wants to know what I came for,
say I’m a reporter for the <i>Courier</i> wanting to see Mrs.
Russell; that’ll do as well as anything else. Here!”</p>

<p>A ten-shilling note changed hands, and Roger turned
to go. A stifled sound from the girl caused him to look
round.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said enquiringly.</p>

<p>“Oo, sir! Mrs. Russell! You don’t think as how
she <em>done</em> it, do you?”</p>

<p>“Done what?” asked Roger gravely.</p>

<p>“P-pushed Mrs. Vane over the cliff! They hated each
other like wild cats, they did. Many and many’s the time
I’ve heard the missis giving it to the master about Mrs.
Vane. ‘If I get hold of her, <em>I’ll</em> give her what-for!’ she
says. ‘I’ll spoil her looks for her! I’ll show her she
can’t⸺’ ”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Roger interrupted hastily. “Good gracious,
no! You mustn’t think anything like that. I want the
shoes for—for quite a different reason.” And he fled
for the front gate.</p>

<p>The maid looked after him with an air of distinct
disappointment.</p>

<p>The newspaper parcel under his arm, Roger made at
top-speed for the point on the cliffs where the second
stair-way emerged. It was only a matter of form to try
the shoes he was carrying into that second lot of
footprints; he knew beyond any shadow of doubt that they
were going to fit. Within a quarter-of-an-hour of leaving
the lady’s own front door his confidence was justified:
her shoes fitted as perfectly into the tracks as if they
had made them—which Roger had very little doubt they
had! With a crow of triumph he turned round and
scurried up the stairs again two at a time. The Ludmouth
Bay Mystery was as good as ended.</p>

<p>Half-way across the open ground toward the house
he caught sight of a large and portly figure turning in
at the front gate from the road. Judging correctly that
the mistress of the household was returning, he changed
his direction abruptly and made for the little ledge,
whistling loudly (and quite unnecessarily, as Anthony
pointed out later with some heat. “Dash it all, man, I
haven’t known the girl for twenty-four hours yet. That
sort of thing makes a chap look such an ass!”) as he
approached within view of it.</p>

<p>“Victory! Victory!” he exclaimed dramatically to the
startled couple beneath him, waving the shoes above his
head. “And here are the spoils—your prize, fair lady!
You might return them to the owner for me some time,
will you? Or rather, to the owner’s parlour maid for
preference. Catch!” And tossing the shoes down on to
the ledge below, he took a standing jump and hurtled
through the air in their wake.</p>

<p>“Roger, you’ve discovered something!” Margaret
cried, as the victorious one landed with a thud perilously
near her feet. “What?”</p>

<p>“I say, you haven’t got to the bottom of it, have you?”
demanded Anthony excitedly.</p>

<p>Roger folded his arms and, striking a Napoleonic
attitude, grinned down most un-Napoleonically at the
other members of the alliance. “I have solved the
Mystery of Ludmouth Bay, my children!” he announced.
“Not alone <em>I</em> did it, for you, Margaret, put me on the
right track, and yon pair of shoes also played their part.
But the important thing is that the mystery is solved,
and you can hold up your head again, Margaret, my
dear, or your hands or your feet or anything else you
jolly well like; nobody will say you nay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Roger, do explain! Not—not Mrs. <em>Russell?</em>”</p>

<p>The grin died slowly out of Roger’s face. His
imagination was his trade, yet it had simply never occurred to
him that the rescue of Margaret meant the snaring of
somebody else—that through his activities Mrs. Russell
now stood in the perilous position from which Margaret
had been plucked only just in time.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” he nodded seriously. “And by the
way, there’s one very obvious thing we overlooked about
you, Margaret,” he went on, glancing at the neat little
feet upon which he had so nearly landed. “However
much the rest of the evidence might seem to compromise
you, you were never in any real danger; that second lot
of footprints was obviously never made by you, you see.
Well, I’ll tell you what I’ve been doing.”</p>

<p>He dropped on to the turf, pulled out his pipe and
began his story.</p>

<p>“I say, that’s great!” exclaimed Anthony in high glee,
when he had finished.</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Mrs. Russell!” was Margaret’s comment,
and Roger glanced at her with quick understanding. It
was an echo of his own thoughts of a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>They began to discuss the situation.</p>

<p>“Well, Anthony,” Roger remarked half-an-hour later.
“Time we were getting back for lunch. And I want to
hear what Moresby’s got to say, too.”</p>

<p>“Moresby’s going to get the shock of his young life,”
observed Anthony grimly. “And I’m going to be in at
the death.” Inspector Moresby, one gathered, had
infringed upon Anthony’s code of things that aren’t done
when he had the presumption to follow up a train of
evidence to its logical conclusion—Margaret;
henceforward there was no good in him.</p>

<p>“Well, in that case come along,” Roger replied,
scrambling up. “Margaret, you’ll deliver those shoes at
the back-door some time this afternoon, will you?
Thanks very much. Well, now, about meeting you again,
I should think⸺”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve fixed all that,” Anthony interrupted very
airily.</p>

<p>It was about five minutes after this that Anthony
delivered his views upon whistling already recorded. At the
same time he had something to say on the subject of
grins, and still more upon that of winks. Grins, winks
and whistles, it appeared, shared with Inspector Moresby
the murkiest depths of Anthony’s hatred and contempt.</p>

<p>Lunch was waiting for them when they arrived back,
hot and thirsty, at the inn—huge plates of cold beef, a
salad, a white loaf and pleasantly salt butter,
raspberry tart and cream. Inspector Moresby was also
waiting for them, his face completely obscured at the moment
of their entering the room by the bottom of one of their
host’s satisfactory tankards (one cannot realise too
strongly the fact that, when not standing at street corners
or arresting unarmed the most dangerous criminals,
members of the British Police Force are utterly and
completely human).</p>

<p>“Ah, here you are, gentlemen,” he observed heartily,
emerging from the tankard. “They asked me if we were
going to take our meals together in here, and I took the
liberty of telling them we were. It’s a bit lonely eating
down there alone, if you’ve no objection.”</p>

<p>“None at all,” responded Roger, no less heartily.
“Only too pleased, Inspector. And I see you had the
forethought to order up three of the best. Excellent!
Well, you’d better get ready to drink my health.”</p>

<p>“What have you been doing then, sir?” asked the
Inspector humorously. “Solving the mystery?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Roger, and plunged into his story
once more.</p>

<p>“So what do you think of that?” he concluded, not
without a certain triumph.</p>

<p>The Inspector wiped his moustache carefully. “It’s
ingenious,” he said. “Quite ingenious. But I shouldn’t
pay too much importance to footprints if I were you,
Mr. Sheringham. Footprints are the easiest thing in the
world to fake.”</p>

<p>“It’s ingenious because we’re dealing with the deeds
of an ingenious criminal. That’s all. Anyhow, can you
produce anything that can’t be explained by the theory?”
Roger challenged.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I can,” replied the inspector imperturbably.
“That bit of paper you picked up yourself. Our expert
made it out all right. The original’s coming on by special
messenger, but I got a code telegram half-an-hour ago,
and I’ve written out for you what was on the paper.
How are you going to explain that by your theory?”</p>

<p>Roger took the piece of paper the other was holding
out to him and read it eagerly, Anthony craning over
his shoulder. It was inscribed as follows:⸺</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="dateline">Monday.</p>

<p>“Elsie darling, for Heaven’s sake meet me once more
before you do anything rash. You must let me explain.
You <em>can’t</em> do what you threaten when you think what we’ve been
to each other. Meet me at the usual place to-morrow, same
time. <em>Please</em>, darling!</p>

<p class="signature">“Colin.”</p>

<p>“P. S. Destroy this.”</p>

</blockquote>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> Colin, Who Art Thou?</h2>

<p>Roger handed the letter back with a little smile.
“How can I explain this by my theory? Well, obviously
enough, surely. ‘Colin’ must be Mr. Russell.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but is he? Somehow I feel pretty sure he isn’t.
Anyhow, that’s a point we can soon settle. I bought a
directory of the neighbourhood yesterday—always do
when I’m working on a case in the country. I’ll run down
and get it.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime,” said Roger, as the inspector’s
heavy footsteps echoed down the stairs, “we might as
well get on with our lunch. I wish I’d taken on a small
bet with him about the identity of friend Colin.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have said there was much doubt about
it,” observed Anthony, helping himself largely to salad.
“It all fits in, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Two minutes later the inspector returned, an open
book in his hand. He laid it down on the table-cloth
beside Roger and indicated an entry in it with a large
thumb.</p>

<p>“There you are, sir,” he said, with a commendable
absence of triumph. “ ‘Russell, John Henry, Rose
Cottage.’ That’s your gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Roger, a little disconcerted. “But look
here,” he added, brightening, “Colin might have been
a pet-name, or something like that.”</p>

<p>The inspector took his place at the table. “It isn’t
likely,” he said, shaking out his napkin. “If it had been
signed Tootles, or Fuzzy-wuzzy, it might have been a
pet-name all right. But Colin! No, that doesn’t sound
like a pet-name to me.”</p>

<p>“Then this appears to complicate matters pretty
considerably,” Roger remarked with some asperity.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, sir,” retorted the inspector
cheerfully, applying himself to his cold beef with every sign
of satisfaction, “perhaps it’s going to simplify them a
lot.”</p>

<p>Roger knew that the inspector was confidently
expecting to be asked to explain this dark observation;
he therefore went on with his meal in silence. Somewhat
to his surprise the inspector volunteered no explanation
of his own accord, his attention appearing to be entirely
divided between his plate and the directory, down the
columns of which he continued to run a careful thumb.</p>

<p>“There are two Colins in this neighbourhood,” he
announced at last. “Smith, Colin, plumber, East Row,
Ludmouth, and Seaford, Colin James, architect, 4 Burnt
Oak Lane, Milbourne (that’s a village a couple of miles
inland). Neither of them looks like our man. But I
hardly expected to find him in here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Anthony.</p>

<p>“Because he’s probably a young man, living with
his parents (isn’t that a young man’s note, Mr.
Sheringham, eh?); in which case of course, he wouldn’t be
mentioned. No, I shall have to spend the afternoon
making enquiries. In the meantime, I’d be much obliged if
you two gentlemen would not say anything about this.
I stretched a point in showing you what was on that
paper, and I want you to reciprocate by keeping quiet
about it. I don’t want <em>anybody</em> told, you understand,”
he added, with a significant look at Anthony; “male <em>or</em>
female! You can promise me that, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” Roger said with a slight smile.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Anthony said stiffly.</p>

<p>“Then that’s all right,” observed the inspector with
great heartiness. “I shan’t be able to do anything until my
man comes down with the original document, of course;
but he ought to be here any time now. And by the way,”
he added to Roger, “it may interest you to hear that I’m
officially in charge of the case now. I got my
authorisation from headquarters this morning.”</p>

<p>Roger picked up his cue. “I’ll mention that in my
report to-night, Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can if you want to, sir, of course,” said
the inspector with an air of innocent surprise.</p>

<p>As if by tacit agreement, the talk for the rest of the
meal turned upon general topics.</p>

<p>As soon as his pipe was alight the inspector rose to
go. Roger waited until he had left the room, then rose
from his chair and darted in his wake, closing the
sitting-room door behind him.</p>

<p>“Inspector,” he said in a low voice, as he caught him
up on the landing, “there’s one question I must ask
you. Are you intending to arrest Miss Cross?”</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him quizzically. “Are you
speaking as a newspaper-man or as a friend of the
lady’s, sir?”</p>

<p>“Neither. As Roger Sheringham, private and
inquisitive citizen.”</p>

<p>“Well,” the inspector said slowly, “to a newspaper-man
I should answer, ‘Don’t ask me leading questions’;
to a friend of the lady’s, ‘I don’t understand what you’re
talking about’; and to Mr. Sheringham, private citizen
and personal friend of my own, if I may say so, ‘No,
I’m not!’ ”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“For one thing, you see,” the inspector added with a
smile, “the evidence against her isn’t quite complete yet.”</p>

<p>“But look here, you don’t mean to say you still think
that she may have⸺”</p>

<p>The inspector waved aside the awkward question with
a large hand. “I’m not going to say what I think about
that, even to you, Mr. Sheringham. But one word of
warning I will give you, to pass on to your cousin or
not as you think fit—things aren’t always what they
seem.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Roger observed. “In other words, I suppose,
ladies strongly under suspicion on circumstantial
evidence aren’t necessarily guilty after all. Is that what
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied the inspector, who seemed not a
little pleased with his conundrum, “that’s all I’ve got to
<em>say</em>. What I <em>mean</em>, you must decide for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Inspector, you’re hopeless!” Roger laughed,
turning back to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Anthony was brooding darkly over his empty
cheese-plate.</p>

<p>“I say, Roger,” he said at once, looking up, “does that
damned inspector still think that Margaret had anything
to do with it?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t imagine so, really. He may, but I’m more
inclined to think that he’s pulling our legs about
her—yours especially. And you are a bit of a trout over
Margaret, aren’t you, Anthony? You rise to any fly that
he dangles over you.”</p>

<p>Anthony made a non-committal growling sound, but
said nothing. Roger began to pace the little room with
restless steps.</p>

<p>“Dash that infernal letter!” he burst out a few minutes
later. “There’s no doubt that it does complicate matters
most awkwardly. Though it doesn’t rule out my bright
solution of before lunch by any means. The inspector
ought to have seen that. What she was doing with friend
Colin doesn’t affect in the slightest degree the bad blood
between her and Mrs. Russell. We mustn’t get confused
by issues that lie outside the main chance.”</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“I must see Margaret!” Roger announced suddenly,
stopping short in his stride. “You muttered something
this morning about having arranged a meeting. For
when?”</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t actually <em>arrange</em> anything,” Anthony
replied with preternatural innocence. “She happened to
say that she’d probably be going out to that ledge this
afternoon about three o’clock with a book, and I just
mentioned that⸺”</p>

<p>“Cease your puling!” Roger interrupted rudely. “It’s
a quarter to three now. Get your hat and come along.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later they were walking briskly up the
rise from the road to the top of the cliffs, the wind
blowing coolly about their heads. It is perhaps not
uninteresting to note in passing that Anthony wore a hat and Roger
did not. And one might go on to add at the same time
that Anthony’s grey flannel trousers were faultlessly
creased, while in Roger’s not a vestige of a crease could
be seen. From this sort of thing the keen psychologist
draws any number of interesting deductions.</p>

<p>“I say, you don’t mind me coming along, Anthony,
do you?” Roger was asking with an appearance of
great anxiety.</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t. Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Isn’t there some old saying about
the difference between a couple and a trio in connection
with company? I mean⸺”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up, for Heaven’s sake! You’re not funny,
Roger.”</p>

<p>“That,” Roger maintained firmly, “is a matter of
opinion. Well, let us talk very seriously about gulls.
There are no less than seven hundred and forty distinct
species of gulls known to the entomologist, of which one
hundred and eighty-two may be found by the intrepid
explorer around the rocky coasts of these Islands.
Perhaps the most common variety is the <i>Patum Perperium</i>,
or Black-hearted Wombat, which may be distinguished
by⸺”</p>

<p>“What <em>are</em> you talking about?” demanded his
bewildered listener.</p>

<p>“Gulls, Anthony,” replied Roger, and went on doing
so with singular ardour right up to the ledge itself.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Margaret,” he greeted its occupant
pleasantly. “Anthony and I have been talking about gulls. Do
you think you could invite us to tea this afternoon with
you?”</p>

<p>“To tea? Whatever for?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s such a long way back to our own. Yours
is so much easier.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take any notice of him, Margaret,” Anthony
advised. “He’s only being funny. He’s been funny ever
since we left the Crown.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and about gulls, too,” Roger added with pride.
“Extraordinarily difficult things to be funny about, as
you’ll readily understand. But I’m quite serious about
tea, Margaret. I want to have a chance of studying the
occupants of your household at close quarters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. But why?”</p>

<p>“No particular reason, except that I ought to have as
close a view as possible of everybody mixed up with
the case. And I must confess that I’m rather interested to
have a look at this doctor-man of yours; he sounds
interesting. Can it be done?”</p>

<p>The girl wrinkled her brow. “Ye-es, I should think
so. Yes, of course it can! I’m keeping house for the
time being, you know. I’ll just take you in with me, and
that’s all there’ll be to it.”</p>

<p>“Good! You needn’t say what we are or anything
about us. Just introduce us as two friends of yours who
are staying down here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand, Miss Williamson will be there, of
course, but I don’t know about George; as often as not
he has a tray sent into the laboratory for him. Still, you
can take the chance.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, we will,” Roger said, descending to the
little ledge. “And now, as we’ve got an hour or so to
spare, I propose that we devote it to an elevating
discussion upon some subject as remote as possible from the
business in hand. How say you, my children?”</p>

<p>“Right!” agreed Anthony, who had taken the
opportunity of propping himself with his back to the rock as
near as possible to Margaret’s side as was consistent
with the convention that a young man shall not sit
directly on top of a young woman to whom he is not
engaged. “Anything you like—except gulls!”</p>

<p>During the next excellent hour Roger, lying on his
back in the shade a couple of yards away and staring
up into the blue sky, could not possibly have seen a
tentative hand emerge from Anthony’s pocket, grope
about the turf in an apparently aimless way for at
least ten minutes and then pluck up the courage at last
to fasten firmly upon another, and very much smaller,
hand which had been lying quite still by its owner’s
side the whole time. He could not possibly have
seen—but he quite definitely knew all about it.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> Tea, China and Young Love</h2>

<p>“By the way, I ought to warn you. Miss Williamson
isn’t exactly an ordinary secretary: she’s rather an
important person. She does any secretarial work George
wants, of course, which is very little, but her chief job
is to help him in the laboratory. She took a science
degree at Cambridge—and I must say,” Margaret added
with a little laugh, “she looks it.”</p>

<p>It was nearly half-past four, and the three of them
were sitting in Dr. Vane’s drawing-room, waiting for
tea and for the other members of the household.
Margaret and Anthony showed distinct signs of
nervousness, though for what exact reason was not really
apparent to either of them; Roger was as collected as
ever. The five-odd minutes which had elapsed since
they entered the room had been spent happily by him
in examining with no little interest the really fine
collection of china which filled two large glass-fronted
cabinets and overflowed on to two or three shelves and,
in the case of a few plates, even the walls themselves.
Roger’s knowledge of china was not a large one, but
he had a sufficiently good smattering to enable him to
talk intelligently on the subject with a collector.</p>

<p>“Don’t be catty, Margaret,” he said now, examining
a Dresden ornament depicting four persons at a
whist-table, the lace of the little ladies’ gowns and of the
miniature fans they fluttered being picked out with
almost incredible daintiness. “I say, surely your cousin
never amassed this collection, did she?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s George’s. The only hobby he’s got apart
from his test-tubes and things. Why?”</p>

<p>“I thought it didn’t seem to fit in very well with the
synopsis you gave me of the lady’s character. Anyhow,
that’s all to the good; I’ll congratulate George on his
collection and he’ll love me like a brother. I’ve met
these china-maniacs before and I think I know how
to deal with them.”</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly right,” Margaret smiled. “It’s
certainly the shortest cut to George’s heart.”</p>

<p>“And before George is much older he’s going to hear
a few things about china,” Anthony was beginning with
heavy sarcasm, when the opening of the drawing-room
door cut him short.</p>

<p>Of the two people who entered the room the next
moment, it is hard to say which presented the more
striking figure. Miss Williamson, who preceded her
employer, would have drawn attention in any company.
She was a tall, angular woman, with high cheek-bones
and close-cropped fair hair, and the pince-nez she wore
seemed to add emphasis to the darting looks of her
cold, slightly prominent blue eyes. Her clothes were
neat to the point of severity and there was that air of
brisk efficiency about her which is likely to reduce the
ordinary man to a condition of tongue-tied uneasiness
when he encounters it in a strange female, it clashes
so persistently with all his ideas of what the word
“feminine” ought to convey. Yet with it all the secretary
was not one of those distressing creatures, a mannish
woman; and though by no means beautiful, she was
not in a way unhandsome. “A distinct personality here,”
Roger told himself before his eyes had been resting
longer than two seconds upon her.</p>

<p>Dr. Vane, who followed close on her heels, bore out
the picture Margaret had already given—a great
hulking man, six feet two inches tall at least, with an
enormous black beard and a stern eye, yet with a
gentleness and delicacy of movement which was in striking
contrast with the rugged strength of his appearance;
as he closed the door behind him, one could scarcely
hear it meet the lintel, so restrained was his action.</p>

<p>Margaret jumped to her feet as the two entered.</p>

<p>“Oh, George, these are two friends of mine, Mr.
Sheringham and Mr. Walton,” she said, not without
confusion. “They called in to see me, not knowing
about—about⸺”</p>

<p>“I am very glad for you to welcome your friends
here, Margaret,” the doctor said with grave
courteousness. “It is after all the very least I can do now that
you are so kindly looking after things here for me.”</p>

<p>Margaret thanked him with a quick smile, and
introduced the two to Miss Williamson. Bows were
exchanged, and the latter rang the bell for tea.</p>

<p>“We’ve only got ten minutes, Margaret,” she said
briskly. “In the middle of something rather important,
and it was as much as I could do to drag George in
here at all.”</p>

<p>The two girls and Anthony formed a group by the
window, and Roger approached Dr. Vane.</p>

<p>“A magnificent collection of china you’ve got here,
doctor,” he said easily. “I’ve been admiring it ever
since I came in. I’ve never seen finer Spode in my life
than those bits over there.”</p>

<p>Into the doctor’s stern eye leapt the light of the
collector who hears his collection praised, which is much
the same as that of the mother who is told that her
infant possesses her own nose. “You are interested in
china, Mr. Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“I’m crazy about it,” returned Roger untruthfully.</p>

<p>The rest simply followed.</p>

<p>With the arrival of tea the conversation became more
general, and Roger was able to allow the novelist in
him to rise to the surface and survey this truly piquant
situation. Here was a man whose wife only three days
ago had met with a violent death in circumstances which
were, to say the least of it, suspicious, receiving his
tea-cup from the hands of a young and pretty girl who,
as he could hardly fail to realise after Inspector
Moresby’s visit, had come very closely under the notice of
the police in connection with the same violent death.
Yet the relations between the two, which might have
been expected to be almost intolerable, did not appear,
on the surface at any rate, to be even so much as strange.
Margaret was perfectly natural; Dr. Vane courteous,
gentle and mildly affectionate. The more Roger watched,
the more he marvelled. Unconventional though he was
in literature as in life, he would hardly have dared to
make use of such a situation for one of his books;
it would have been voted too wildly improbable.</p>

<p>The talk, which had shifted for a few minutes to
trifles, showed a tendency to revert, so far as Dr. Vane
was concerned, to his former topic. Somewhat to Roger’s
surprise, Miss Williamson joined in as the doctor
warmed again to his theme, even going so far as to
put him right once or twice upon small points of
detail.</p>

<p>“You’re an enthusiast too, then?” Roger could not
help asking her.</p>

<p>“Now, yes,” she replied. “When I first came I knew
nothing about it at all, but George showed me the way
and now I’m as much under the spell even as he is.”</p>

<p>“And know a good deal more about it, Mary, don’t
you?” commented the doctor, with the first signs of
a smile he had yet displayed. “Another case of the pupil
and the master, I’m afraid, Mr. Sheringham,” he added
to Roger, with an air of mock disgust.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, George!” Miss Williamson laughed.
“I only wish I did. You’ve got a great deal to teach me
yet, I fear.”</p>

<p>Fortunately it was clear that Dr. Vane had no idea
of the identity of his visitor, as also had not Miss
Williamson (indeed, neither of them looked the sort of
person who might be expected to read the <i>Courier</i>),
so that no suspicion as to the reason of his call could
occur to either of them. Roger, content enough with the
success of his tactics, continued to play the safe card
of china; while Margaret and Anthony, to neither of
whom china contained the least interest, were reduced
for the most part to sitting and looking at each other
in silence. They seemed perfectly content with this state
of affairs.</p>

<p>When, half-an-hour later instead of ten minutes, Miss
Williamson issued her third ultimatum which had the
effect of bringing the doctor to his feet at last, Roger
felt he had had enough of china to last him for several
years. Dr. Vane, however, could not have felt the same,
for he shook his visitor warmly by the hand and, having
ascertained that he and Anthony expected to be staying
several days in Ludmouth, invited both of them to
supper on the following Sunday, brushing aside Roger’s
half-hearted attempts at a refusal with a firmness that
was almost genial.</p>

<p>Roger sank back into his chair as the door closed
behind them and fanned himself with a limp hand.
“Did I happen to hear anyone mention the word china
just now?” he asked feebly.</p>

<p>“Well?” Margaret demanded. “What did you think
of them?”</p>

<p>“What did I think?” Roger repeated, speaking for
the moment from the fullness of his heart. “I think
that within a year or so the wedding-bells will be heard
once more in Ludmouth.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” cried Anthony and Margaret together.</p>

<p>Roger realised that he had spoken unguardedly, but
it was too late to withdraw his words. “I think,” he
said more carefully, “that George and that lady will
make a match of it.”</p>

<p>“She’s head over heels in love with him,” Margaret
nodded. “I’ve known that for years. But I didn’t expect
you to notice it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my business, fair lady,” Roger returned
sweetly.</p>

<p>“You <em>saw</em> she was keen on him?” Anthony asked in
astonishment. “How on earth did you do that?”</p>

<p>“For the answer to this question, refer to my last
remark,” Roger murmured. “Alternative answer—china!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that rather gave it away,” Margaret agreed.
“Especially after what I’d said before. Do you
remember?”</p>

<p>“It was that I was thinking of,” Roger laughed.</p>

<p>Anthony looked from one to the other. “What <em>are</em>
you two talking about?” he appealed.</p>

<p>“Nothing that you’d understand, little boy,” said
Roger kindly. “Run away and play with the blind-tassel.
I like your doctor-man, Margaret.”</p>

<p>“George? Yes, he’s a dear, isn’t he? Though it took
me ever so much longer to know him than it seems to
have taken you. And he liked you too. I’ve never known
him to ask anyone to supper on such a short
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> rather likable,” Roger admitted.</p>

<p>The conversation then became purely frivolous.</p>

<p>Having achieved the object with which he had set out,
Roger was anxious to talk over its results with Anthony—a
thing that could hardly be done in this case in the
presence of Margaret. It was not long before he began
to show signs of readiness to embark on the process
of leave-taking. He ostentatiously arranged a meeting
with Margaret the next morning “just in case,” he rose
to his feet, hovered near the door, sat down and rose
again, and he said that they must be going at least
half-a-dozen times over, each time more as if he meant it
than before. At this point he realised that nothing short
of heroic measures would be likely to shift Anthony
from that drawing-room.</p>

<p>Roger was not the person to shirk heroic measures
when nothing short of heroic measures was required.
“Anthony,” he said with decision, “I don’t think you
realise that we’re out-staying our welcome. I’ve been
trying to hint gently for the last quarter-of-an-hour that
it’s time we were going. Margaret’s sure to have lots
to do, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t, Roger,” Margaret objected.
“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” Roger said firmly. “Lots. Come on,
Anthony.”</p>

<p>“No, really I haven’t. Nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have. Come <em>on</em>, Anthony!”</p>

<p>This time Anthony came.</p>

<p>Margaret said good-bye to them in the drawing-room,
and from the hall Anthony had to go back to tell her
something he’d forgotten. Roger waited five minutes;
then he followed and dug Anthony out again. Margaret
came out into the hall with them and said good-bye
there, and from half-way down the drive Anthony had
to go back for his stick. Roger waited ten minutes, then
he followed once more, running the culprit to earth
again in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“Anthony, I think we ought to be going now,” he
said. “Job speaking. Anthony, I think we ought to be
going now. Have you remembered to say all you’d
forgotten to remember to say? Have you your stick, your
hat, your shoes, your tie-pin, your spectacles and your
lace cap? Anthony, I think we ought to be going.
Margaret, perhaps if you were to go and immure
yourself in your bedroom or the bathroom or the
linen-cupboard or any other suitable place of immurement,
I think Anthony might be induced in despair to⸺”</p>

<p>“Roger, I <em>hate</em> you!” Margaret gasped in a stifled
voice, hurrying with burning cheeks out of the room.</p>

<p>“Portrait of a lady on her way to immurement,”
murmured Roger thoughtfully, gazing after her flying figure.</p>

<p>“Damn you, Roger!” spluttered the indignant
Anthony, no less puce. “What the deuce do you want to
go and⸺”</p>

<p>“Anthony, I think it’s time we were going,” Roger
pointed out gently.</p>

<p>This time Anthony really did go, not only out of
the house but right down the drive, over the road and
on to the cliffs.</p>

<p>Roger gave him ten minutes to work off steam and
simmer down again; then he got on with the business
in hand.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Anthony, drop all that and tell me
this—what deductions did you draw at our little
tea-party?”</p>

<p>“What deductions?” Anthony said a little reluctantly.
“I don’t know that I drew any. Did you?”</p>

<p>“One or two. That the lady we had the pleasure of
meeting wouldn’t be at all averse to becoming Mrs. Vane
now that the post is vacant, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“How on earth could you tell that, Roger?”</p>

<p>“It was sticking out in lumps all over her for
anybody who had the eyes to see. In fact it seemed to me
that she wasn’t even troubling to hide it. But was the
doctor-man equally minded? Now that I’m not nearly
so sure about.”</p>

<p>“You think he isn’t?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t say that for a minute. What I do say
is that he’s very much better at hiding his feelings. I
couldn’t tell what he was thinking at all, except that
he’s fond of Margaret and anxious to show it. The only
really significant thing about him was the fact of his
asking us to supper like that.”</p>

<p>“You mean only four or five days after his wife’s
death?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Now what does that show?”</p>

<p>“That he’s not any too cut up about it.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. In other words, I should say, he knew
his wife’s true character. And not being sorry she’s
dead, he’s not going to pretend that he is; that’s how
the man strikes me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Anthony said slowly. “I think I agree with
you.”</p>

<p>“Nor is the woman. That was obvious enough. He
may even be taking his cue from her. She’s without
doubt the stronger character of the two.”</p>

<p>“Is she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Then there’s another thing. Does the
woman know Mrs. Vane’s real character too? On the
whole I should be inclined to say yes. She’s pretty
sharp.”</p>

<p>“That might even have started her being keen on
him,” Anthony pointed out; “if she really is. I mean,
it must have been a pretty ghastly sight to see a decent
chap like that tied up to a little rotter of a woman,
mustn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s a very shrewd idea,” Roger agreed. “Yes,
I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if that isn’t how things
did happen. Gradually, of course; these things always
do. I’m not hinting that there was an intrigue between
them or anything like that; I don’t for a moment think
there was. In fact, I shouldn’t be surprised if the doctor
hasn’t got the least idea about her feelings even now.
But he’ll find himself marrying her one day for all
that. She’s a woman of unusually strong mind and she’s
made it up on that particular point all right, I wouldn’t
mind betting.”</p>

<p>“She had large feet,” said Anthony quite irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“So have a number of people. You, for instance.
Did it strike you whether she liked Margaret?”</p>

<p>“She’d be a fool if she didn’t,” said Anthony with
complete conviction.</p>

<p>“Do refrain from being maudlin, Anthony.
Personally, I thought she didn’t. She was inclined to be
peremptory and not a little bossy, did you notice? But
jealousy would quite well account for that. After all,
Margaret is young and pretty and she’s neither. Did
anything else strike you about Dr. Vane? About his
character, or anything like that?”</p>

<p>Anthony considered. “I should think he’s probably
got the very devil of a temper,” he decided.</p>

<p>“You take the words out of my mouth. That’s
precisely what struck me. I don’t suppose it has any
significance at all, but it’s a point that we might well
keep before us. Dr. Vane has the very devil of a temper.
Now, about that invitation, I don’t— Hullo! Isn’t that
the inspector on the road? Yes, it is; I’d know that bulky
form anywhere. Let’s cut across and see if he’s got any
news. By the way, congratulations, Anthony.”</p>

<p>“What on?”</p>

<p>“Not saying anything to Margaret about friend
Colin’s letter. A most admirable piece of self-restraint.”</p>

<p>A lusty hail from Roger brought the inspector to a
standstill. He halted and waited for them to catch up
with him.</p>

<p>“It’s a hot day for running about, gentlemen,” he
greeted them mopping his large red face. “Uncommonly
hot.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Inspector. And has virtue brought its
own reward, or have you got any news?”</p>

<p>“I have got some news, sir, I’m glad to say. I’ve
succeeded in locating the gentleman who wrote that
letter. Been a bit of a job, but I’m pretty sure I’ve found
him this time.”</p>

<p>“You have, have you? I say, that’s good! Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“Gentleman by the name of Colin Woodthorpe; son
of a Sir Henry Woodthorpe who’s got a big place
between here and Sandsea. I thought of going round to
call on him this evening.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Roger promptly. “May I come?”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit irregular, sir.”</p>

<p>“I know it is. Frightfully irregular. But you do owe
me something over the letter, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” the inspector grinned. “I can see
you’re determined to come, so I suppose I shall have
to take you with me. But it’ll have to be as that
personal friend of mine, mind, not as a newspaper-man.”</p>

<p>“On my oath!” said Roger piously. “In any case I
wouldn’t— Oh, Heavens, talk hard and don’t let me be
buttonholed. This is the most persistent talker in the
south of England coming along the road toward us.”</p>

<p>“When you’re in the north, Roger,” Anthony
amended humorously.</p>

<p>“His name is the Rev. Samuel Meadows,” Roger went
on to the inspector. “He caught me on the cliffs this
morning and held me for half-an-hour by the clock.
The Ancient Mariner couldn’t make a match of it with
him.”</p>

<p>In some curiosity the other two watched the little
clerical figure approach. He smiled benignly as he
recognised Roger and touched the wide brim of his hat
in a somewhat expansive gesture, but made no attempt
to speak.</p>

<p>“Saved!” Roger murmured dramatically as they
passed him. “Friends, I thank you!”</p>

<p>But the inspector did not smile. His brow was
corrugated and he was tugging at his long-suffering
moustache.</p>

<p>“Now, where the dickens,” he remarked very
thoughtfully to his boots, “have I seen <em>that</em> face before?”</p>

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> Inspector Moresby Conducts an Interview</h2>

<p>Clouston Hall, the home of Sir Henry and Lady
Woodthorpe, was a stolidly built Georgian house, with
the usual aspect of square solidity so happily typical
of its period. It stood in its own grounds of nine or ten
acres, and as Roger and the inspector made their way
up the trim drive the setting sun was burnishing the
mellow brick of its front to a deeper red and slanting
over the velvety expanse of lawn, unprofaned by tennis
nets or chalk lines, which faced it across the broad
carriage-sweep.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” Roger exclaimed softly. “It’s a fine
picture, isn’t it? There’s something about these big
Georgian country houses, you know, Inspector, that does
stir the imagination. Can’t you just see that
carriage-sweep stiff with huntsmen in red coats and jolly red
faces, all engulfing a couple of gallons of home-brew
before going off to give Reynard the run of his life?”</p>

<p>“It’s a tidy bit of property,” the inspector agreed.
“But they’re child’s-play for burglars, these old houses
are.” To every man his own point of view.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is that always makes one associate
Georgian houses with hunting scenes,” Roger mused.
“Must be the red, I suppose. Red brick, red coats, red
faces. Yes, red seems to be the key-colour of the times.
What would Rowlandson have done if there’d been no
red on his palette? He’d have had to draw people
without any noses at all.”</p>

<p>They reached the white porch, and the inspector
placed a large thumb over the un-Georgian electric
bell-push. “You’ll remember, Mr. Sheringham, won’t you?”
he said half apologetically. “We’re here on official
business, and it’s me who’s got to do all the talking.”</p>

<p>“Did I or did I not give you my solemn word,
Inspector?” queried Roger in hurt tones. “Besides, I
would have you know that at school my nickname was
‘Oyster.’ ‘Oyster Sheringham,’ I was invariably called.”</p>

<p>“There’s often an untrue word spoken in jest,”
murmured the inspector with a face of preternatural
innocence.</p>

<p>Before Roger could reply suitably the door was
opened by a large and fish-like butler.</p>

<p>There are few men in this country who can remain
their normal selves in face of a truly fish-like specimen
of the English butler. Roger’s admiration of his
companion increased almost visibly as he watched him
confront this monumental dolphin (that was the word which
rose unbidden into Roger’s mind the moment the door
opened) without so much as a blench.</p>

<p>“I want to see Mr. Colin Woodthorpe,” said the
inspector heartily, in a voice free from the slightest
tremor. “Is he at home?”</p>

<p>“I will enquire, sir,” returned the dolphin coldly,
eyeing their dusty appearance with obvious pain, and
made as if to close the door. “Would you care to leave
your name?”</p>

<p>The inspector placed a large foot in the aperture.
“You needn’t put on any of those frills with me,” he
said with the utmost cheerfulness. “You know whether
the gentleman I want to see is at home or not.” He
paused and looked the other in the eye. “<em>Is he?</em>” he
shot out with startling abruptness.</p>

<p>Roger watched the dolphin’s reaction to this mode
of attack with some interest. His gills opened and closed
rapidly, and a look of distinct alarm appeared in his
pale sandy eyes. Roger had never seen an alarmed
butler before, and he certainly never expected to see one
again.</p>

<p>“He—he was in to dinner, sir,” gasped the dolphin,
almost before he knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>“Ha!” observed the inspector, evidently satisfied.
“Then you cut along, my man, and tell him that
Inspector Moresby of Scotland Yard would like a word
or two with him. And you needn’t shout it out for all
the rest of the world to hear, understand?” It appeared
that the dolphin understood. “Very well. Now show us
somewhere where we can wait.”</p>

<p>The chastened dolphin led them into a small room
on the left of the big hall, the gun-room. As the door
closed behind him, Roger seized the inspector’s hand
and wrung it reverently. “Now I see how you can
arrest seventeen armed criminals in the most dangerous
dive in Limehouse with nothing but a walking-stick and
a safety-pin,” he said in awe-struck tones. “ ‘My man!’
And yet the heavens remain intact!”</p>

<p>“I never stand nonsense from butlers,” remarked the
inspector modestly.</p>

<p>Roger shielded his eyes and groaned.</p>

<p>Colin Woodthorpe, who made his appearance a couple
of minutes later, proved to be a pleasant-looking young
man of some five- or six-and-twenty, with fair hair and
a sanguine complexion, big and sturdy; he was
wearing a dinner-jacket, but Roger instinctively saw him in
gaiters and riding-breeches. He was perfectly
self-possessed.</p>

<p>“Inspector Moresby?” he asked with a little smile,
picking out Roger’s companion without hesitation.</p>

<p>“That’s me, sir,” assented the inspector in his usual
genial tones. “Sorry to bother you, but duty’s duty, as
you know. I hope that butler of yours didn’t make too
much pother. I told him not to. Scotland Yard has a
nasty sound in the ears of the old people, I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” laughed the young man. “As a matter of
fact I was alone, though it was very kind of you to think
of warning him. Well, what’s it all about, Inspector?
Sit down, won’t you? Cigarette?”</p>

<p>“Well, thank you, sir,” The inspector helped himself
to a cigarette from the other’s case and disposed his
bulk in a comfortable leather-covered armchair. Roger
followed suit.</p>

<p>As the young man sat down, the inspector edged his
chair round so as to be able to look him directly in the
face. “As I said, sir, I’m sorry to bother you, but it’s
this matter of Mrs. Vane’s death I’m looking into.” He
paused significantly.</p>

<p>Roger could have sworn that a look of apprehension
flitted for an instant across the young man’s face, but
his voice when he spoke after only a second’s
hesitation was perfectly under control.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes?” he said easily (almost <em>too</em> easily, Roger
felt). “And why have you come to me?”</p>

<p>The inspector’s hand shot out toward him, holding
the piece of paper he had already drawn from his
pocket. “To ask you to explain this, sir, if you please,”
he said very much more brusquely.</p>

<p>Colin Woodthorpe looked at the paper curiously;
then, as his brain took in the significance of the words
written upon it he flushed deeply. “Where—how did
you get hold of this?” he asked in a voice that was none
too steady.</p>

<p>The inspector explained briefly that the original had
been found among the rocks close to where the body
was lying. “I want you to explain it, if you please, sir,”
he concluded. “I need not point out to you its importance
as far as we are concerned. You ask the lady to meet
you, and on the very day you arrange she meets her
death. If you kept the appointment, it seems to us that
you ought to be able to shed some light on that death.
I need hardly ask you whether you did keep it?”</p>

<p>The young man had recovered himself to some
extent. He frowned and crossed his legs. “Look here, I
don’t understand this. I thought Mrs. Vane’s death was
an accident. They’ve had the inquest, and that was the
verdict. Why are you ‘looking into it,’ as you say?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” the inspector returned in his usual
cheerful tones, “I came here to ask questions, not to answer
them. Still, I don’t mind answering that one. The fact
of the matter is that we’re not at all sure that Mrs. Vane’s
death <em>was</em> an accident.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the young man was genuinely
startled. “Good Heavens!” he cried. “What on earth
do you mean? What else could it be?”</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him quizzically. “Well—it
might have been suicide, mightn’t it?” he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“Suicide!” Woodthorpe sat up with a jerk and his
rosy face paled. “You don’t—you don’t really mean to
say you think it might have been, Inspector?”</p>

<p>“Have <em>you</em> any particular reason for thinking it might
have been, sir?” the inspector shot out.</p>

<p>The young man sat back in his chair again,
moistening his lips with a quick movement of his tongue. “No,
of course not,” he muttered. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do, sir,” retorted the inspector grimly.
“Now look here, Mr. Woodthorpe,” he went on in a
more kindly voice. “I want you to put down your cards
on the table and tell me the whole story. Believe me,
it’s far and away the best thing to do, from your point
of view as well as ours. It’s bound to come out in the
end you know. And⸺”</p>

<p>Woodthorpe had risen to his feet. “Excuse me,
Inspector,” he interrupted stiffly, “I must repeat that I
don’t understand you. I have nothing to tell you. Is that
all you wished to see me about?”</p>

<p>He walked toward the door as if inviting the other
to rise and take his departure, but the inspector blandly
ignored the hint.</p>

<p>“Of course I know what you’re feeling, sir,” he
remarked. “You’re trying to shield the lady’s reputation,
I know that. Well, the best way you can do so is to
answer my questions. I’ve got to get my information,
and if I get it from you we may be able to keep it
between ourselves; if you force me to try other sources,
I’m afraid there’s no hope of keeping it dark. At present
(if you haven’t given yourselves away elsewhere) there’s
nobody but you and us who knows that you were Mrs.
Vane’s lover.”</p>

<p>Woodthorpe looked at him steadily. “Inspector,” he
said slowly, “may I say that you are being offensive?”</p>

<p>“Can’t help that, sir, I’m afraid,” replied the
inspector cheerily. “And if you’re not going to be open
with me, I daresay you’ll find me more offensive still.
And you can’t bluff me, sir, you know. Not that I blame
you for trying; I’d do the same myself for a lady I’d
got into a mess with.” The inspector’s choice of words
may not have been fortunate, but his sentiment was
admirable. “Still, you’ve given yourself away too much
in this note, you know, sir—besides what I’ve been able
to find out elsewhere. For instance, I know that Mrs.
Vane had been your mistress for some little time, that
you’d got tired of her and were trying to break with
her, and that she was threatening you if you did. I know
all the essentials, you see. It’s only a few details I want
you to tell me, and I’d much rather have them from
you than from anybody else.”</p>

<p>The young man had put up a good fight, but it was
plain to Roger that he now accepted defeat. Indeed, it
was difficult to see what else he could do. Dropping
back into his chair, he acknowledged the truth of the
inspector’s words by a tacit hiatus. “If I answer your
questions,” he said curtly, “will you treat what I tell you
as private and confidential?”</p>

<p>“As far as I possibly can, sir,” the inspector
promised. “It’s no wish of mine to drag out unnecessary
scandals, or make things awkward which might have
been better left undisturbed.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see what you’re driving at, in any case,”
Woodthorpe said wearily, lighting another cigarette.
“Mrs. Vane is dead, isn’t she? What does it matter
whether her death was accident or suicide? It can’t
help <em>her</em> to have these things raked over.”</p>

<p>“It’s my duty to look into it, sir,” replied the
inspector primly. “Now, when I mentioned the word
‘suicide’ just now you were startled, weren’t you? Did it
cross your mind that she might have killed herself
because you insisted on breaking with her, and she didn’t
want to let you go?”</p>

<p>Woodthorpe flushed. “Yes,” he admitted reluctantly.
“It did.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Having succeeded in impressing the young
man with his own mental acuteness, the inspector
proceeded to the questions of real importance. “Did you
keep that appointment, sir?”</p>

<p>“No.” Reconciled as he now was to the necessity of
being frank, Woodthorpe spoke with no hesitation or
sullenness. “You were wrong about that note of mine.
It’s nearly three weeks old. That appointment was for
a fortnight ago last Tuesday, and I did keep it then.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The inspector’s voice did not show the
slightest surprise at this unexpected piece of news; Roger’s
face, on the contrary, betrayed the liveliest
astonishment. “And where was the meeting held, sir? What, in
fact, is ‘the usual place’?”</p>

<p>“A little cave we knew of on that ledge, quite near
the place she was killed. I discovered it about a year
ago; and was struck with its privacy. Anyone who didn’t
know of it would never find it. The mouth is at an angle
in the rock, and there’s a big boulder masking it. We’ve
been in there heaps of times when people have passed by
outside without spotting us.”</p>

<p>“How many times have you met Mrs. Vane since
then?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I broke with her finally at that meeting.”
He shifted a little uneasily in his chair, and Roger
guessed that the process of breaking had not been a
simple one. “I’d like to add, by the way,” he went on
a little stiffly, “that the fault for the whole thing was
mine. Mrs. Vane was in no way to blame. I⸺”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave that for the moment, sir, if you don’t
mind,” the inspector interrupted. “It’s facts I’m after,
not faults. Why did you decide to break with Mrs.
Vane?”</p>

<p>“For private reasons,” Woodthorpe replied shortly,
setting his jaw and looking very obstinate indeed.</p>

<p>The inspector abandoned that point. “What was Mrs.
Vane threatening to do if you broke with her?” he
asked bluntly.</p>

<p>“Tell her husband,” replied the other, no less
bluntly.</p>

<p>The inspector whistled. “Whew! The whole story?”</p>

<p>“The whole story.”</p>

<p>“But that would have meant divorce!”</p>

<p>“She said she didn’t mind about that.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” The inspector turned this surprising
information over in his mind. “How long had you
been—well, friendly with her?” he continued, somewhat
inadequately, after a short pause.</p>

<p>“For about a year,” replied Woodthorpe, who
evidently understood what the inspector’s delicacy was
intended to convey.</p>

<p>“Did you have many quarrels during that time?”</p>

<p>“About as many as other people do, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not more than you might expect to have with any
other woman?”</p>

<p>“Well—perhaps a few more,” Woodthorpe admitted
awkwardly.</p>

<p>Frantic signs from Roger conveyed the information to
the inspector that his companion was anxious to put a
question of his own. As the conversation had taken a
psychological turn, the inspector saw no harm in
graciously according permission.</p>

<p>“Did you find that you had cause as time went on
very considerably to modify your original estimate of
the lady’s character?” Roger asked, choosing his words
with some care.</p>

<p>Woodthorpe shot him a grateful look. “Yes,” he said
instantly. “I did.”</p>

<p>Roger held him with a thoughtful eye. “Would you
call her,” he said slowly, “an <em>imprudent</em> woman?”</p>

<p>Woodthorpe hesitated. “I don’t know. In some things,
damnably! In others, very much the reverse.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded as if satisfied. “Yes, that’s just what
I imagined.—All right, carry on, Inspector. Sorry to
have interrupted you.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> Real Bad Blood</h2>

<p>“Well?” Roger asked, as the two of them
walked down the drive again half-an-hour or so later.
“Well, what did you make of that young man,
Inspector?”</p>

<p>“A very nice young gentleman, I thought,” returned
the inspector guardedly. “What did you, Mr.
Sheringham, sir?”</p>

<p>“I thought the same as you,” Roger replied
innocently.</p>

<p>“Um!” observed the inspector.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>“You brought out your deductions from the
wording of that note very pat and cleverly,” Roger remarked.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the inspector.</p>

<p>There was another little silence.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m quite sure he knows nothing about it,”
Roger burst out.</p>

<p>The inspector bestowed a surreptitious grin on a small
rambling rose. “Are you, sir?” he said. Mr. Roger
Sheringham was perhaps not the only psychologist
walking down the drive of Clouston Hall at that moment.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you, Inspector?” Roger demanded
point-blank.</p>

<p>“Um!” replied the inspector carefully.</p>

<p>“If he does, he’s a better actor than ever I’ve met
before,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“I was watching him closely, and I’m convinced his
surprise was genuine,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“He certainly believed her death had been
accidental,” said Roger.</p>

<p>“I’ll stake my life he knows nothing about it,” said
Roger defiantly.</p>

<p>“Will you, sir?” queried the inspector blandly.
“Well, well!”</p>

<p>Roger cut viciously with his stick at an inoffensive
daisy.</p>

<p>There was another little silence.</p>

<p>They turned out of the drive and began to tramp
along the dusty highroad.</p>

<p>“Still,” said Roger cunningly, “we got some
extraordinarily valuable information out of him, didn’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the inspector.</p>

<p>“Which goes some way to confirm a rather interesting
new theory of my own,” said Roger, still more
cunningly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the inspector.</p>

<p>Roger began to whistle.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the inspector very airily, “what
exactly was the significance of that question you put
to him about Mrs. Vane being an imprudent woman,
sir? Why ‘imprudent’?”</p>

<p>“Um!” said Roger.</p>

<p>In this way the time passed pleasantly till they
returned to their inn. An impartial spectator would
probably have given it as his opinion by that time that the
honours were even, with, if anything, a slight bias in
favour of the inspector. Roger retired to telephone his
report through to London, stretching his meagre amount
of straw into as many bricks as possible, and the
inspector disappeared altogether, presumably to chew
over the cud of his mission. Anthony was not in the inn
at all.</p>

<p>Returning from the telephone, Roger looked into the
little bar-parlour; three yokels and a dog were there.
He looked into their private sitting-room; nobody was
there. He looked into each of their bedrooms; nobody
was there either. Then he took up his station outside
Inspector Moresby’s bedroom, laid back his head, and
proceeded to give a creditable imitation of a
bloodhound baying the moon. The effect was almost
instantaneous.</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” exclaimed the startled inspector,
emerging precipitately in his shirt-sleeves. “Was—was
that you, Mr. Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Roger, pleased. “Did you like it?”</p>

<p>“I did not,” replied the inspector with decision. “Are
you often taken that way, sir?”</p>

<p>“Only when I’m feeling very chatty, and nobody will
talk to me or occasionally when I’ve been trying to
thought-read, and nobody will tell me whether I’m right
or wrong. Otherwise, hardly at all.”</p>

<p>The inspector laughed. “Very well, sir. I guess I have
been trying your patience a bit. But now you’ve got
that telephone business done with, perhaps we might
have a chat.”</p>

<p>“Distrustful lot of men, the police,” Roger
murmured. “Disgustingly. Well, what about a visit to the
sitting-room? That bottle of whisky isn’t nearly finished,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in half-a-minute, sir,” said the
inspector quite briskly.</p>

<p>Roger went on ahead and mixed two drinks, one stiff,
one so stiff as to be almost rigid. The inspector,
smacking his lips over the latter two minutes later, remarked
regretfully that that was good stuff for nowadays, that
was, but it was a pity they filled the bottles half up
with water in these times before the stuff ever got into
a glass at all. It is a hard business, trying to loosen a
Scotland Yard Inspector’s tongue.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Roger, pulling himself together
and settling down more comfortably in his chair. “Well,
now, Inspector, what about it all? If you feel a little
more disposed to be confidential, isn’t this rather a
good opportunity to review the case as it stands at
present? I’m inclined to think it is.”</p>

<p>The inspector set down his glass and wiped his
moustache. “You mean, while there’s only two of us
to do the discussing instead of three?” he asked with
a large wink.</p>

<p>“Exactly. My cousin’s outlook is—well, not
altogether unprejudiced.”</p>

<p>“And is yours, sir?” asked the inspector shrewdly.</p>

<p>Roger laughed. “A palpable hit. Well, I certainly
do <em>not</em> think the young lady in whom you’ve been taking
so much interest has anything to do with it, I must
confess. In fact, I’ll go further and say that I’ve absolutely
made up my mind on the point.”</p>

<p>“And yet the evidence points more conclusively to
her than to anybody else,” remarked the inspector
mildly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no doubt. But evidence can be faked, can’t it?
And you yourself were pointing out to me only a few
hours ago that things aren’t always what they seem.”</p>

<p>“Was I, now?” queried the inspector, with an air
of gentle surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Inspector, don’t start fencing with me again!”
Roger implored. “I’ve given you a perfectly good
drink, I’m prepared to hand over to you all my startling
and original ideas—do try to be human!”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Sheringham, what is it you want to
discuss?” asked the inspector, evidently trying hard to be
human.</p>

<p>“Everything!” returned Roger largely. “Our
interview just now; my idea about Mrs. Russell; your
suspicions of Miss Cross (if you really have suspicions,
and aren’t just pulling my leg)—everything!”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” said the inspector equably. “Where
shall we start?”</p>

<p>“Well, we began just now with Miss Cross. I want to
add a word to the very dogmatic statement I made,
though it’s not really necessary. You know, of course,
why I’m so convinced she had nothing to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t make you wild by saying ‘because she’s
an uncommonly pretty girl,’ ” the inspector smiled. “I’ll
wrap it up a bit more and say ‘because you think she
couldn’t commit a murder to save her life.’ ”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Roger nodded. “In other words, for
overwhelmingly psychological reasons. If that girl isn’t
as transparently straight as they make ’em, may I never
call myself a judge of character again!”</p>

<p>“She <em>is</em> uncommonly pretty, I must say,” remarked
the inspector non-committally.</p>

<p>Roger disregarded the irrelevance. “You must have
to make use of psychology in your business, Inspector,
and continual use too. Every detective must be a
psychologist, whether he knows it or not. Don’t all your
instincts tell you that girl’s as innocent—I don’t mean
merely of this crime, but innocent-<em>minded</em>—as you’d
wish any daughter of your own to be?”</p>

<p>The inspector tugged at his moustache. “We
detectives may have to know a bit about psychology, as you
say, sir; I’m not disputing that. But it’s our business
to deal in facts, not fancies; and the thing we’ve got to
pay most attention to is evidence. And in nine cases out
of ten I’ll back evidence (even purely circumstantial
evidence like this) against all the psychology in the
world.”</p>

<p>Roger smiled. “The professional point of view, as
opposed to the amateur. Well, naturally I don’t agree
with you, and as I said, I’m not at all sure that you
aren’t pulling my leg about Miss Cross all the time.
Let’s go on to that interview of ours this evening. I
needn’t ask you whether you saw that Master Colin
wasn’t being altogether as frank with us as he might
have been. He was keeping something back, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He was, sir,” the inspector agreed cheerfully. “His
real reason for breaking with Mrs. Vane.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I meant. You don’t think it was
the reason he certainly wanted us to believe,
then—that he was bored with her?”</p>

<p>“I know it wasn’t,” the inspector returned shrewdly.
“He’s a chivalrous young gentleman as far as the ladies
are concerned, is Mr. Woodthorpe, and he’d never break
with an old flame who was still desperately in love with
him merely because he’d got bored with her. There was
some much more powerful reason than that behind it.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Roger. “I was right; you are a
psychologist, after all, Inspector. And what do you think of this
reason that friend Colin is so industriously hiding from
us?”</p>

<p>“I think,” the inspector said slowly, “that it would
go a long way toward clearing up the case for us, if
we knew it.”</p>

<p>Roger whistled. “As important as all that, eh? I must
say, I hadn’t arrived at that conclusion myself. And
have you got any inkling as to its nature?”</p>

<p>“Well—!” The inspector took a sup of whisky and
wiped his moustache again with some deliberation.
“Well, the most likely thing would be another girl,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You mean, he’d fallen seriously in love elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“<em>And</em> wanted to get engaged to her,” the inspector
amplified. “<em>Was</em> engaged to her secretly, if you like.
That’s the only thing I can see important enough to
make him resolve to break with Mrs. Vane at all costs.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded slowly. “Yes, I think you’re right.—But
I’m blessed if I see how knowing it for certain is
going to clear up the case for you?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you, sir?” the inspector replied cautiously.
“Well perhaps it’s only a whim of mine, so we’ll say
no more about it for the time being.”</p>

<p>Roger’s curiosity was piqued, but he knew that its
gratification was impossible. Accepting defeat, he turned
to another aspect of the case.</p>

<p>“What did you think of that Russell theory of mine,
by the way?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Since you ask me, sir,” answered the inspector with
candour, “nothing!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Roger, somewhat dashed.</p>

<p>“I’d already collected all the gossip on those lines,”
the inspector proceeded more kindly, “and I’ve had a
few words with the lady herself, as well as her
husband. It didn’t take long to satisfy me that there was
nothing for me there.”</p>

<p>Roger, who had confidently assumed that the Russell
idea had been his and his alone, looked his chagrin.
“But it <em>was</em> a woman who was with Mrs. Vane before
she died,” he argued. “And a woman with large feet
at that. In fact, it hardly seems too much to assume that
it was a woman with large feet who pushed Mrs. Vane
over that cliff. Find a woman with large feet who’d got
a big grudge against Mrs. Vane, and—! Well, anyhow,
why are you so sure that Mrs. Russell is out of it?”</p>

<p>“She’s got an alibi. I followed it up, naturally.
Cast-iron. Whoever the woman was, it wasn’t Mrs. Russell.
But don’t forget what I said once before, will you, Mr.
Sheringham? Footprints are the easiest things in the
world to fake.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Roger stroked his chin with a thoughtful
air. “You mean, they might have been made by a man
with small feet, wearing a woman’s shoes for the
express purpose?”</p>

<p>“It might have been anything,” said the inspector
guardedly. “All that those footprints mean to me at
present is that there was another <em>person</em> on that ledge
with Mrs. Vane.”</p>

<p>“And that person was the murderer?”</p>

<p>“You might put it like that.”</p>

<p>Roger considered further. “You’ve gone into the
question of motive, of course. Has it struck you what a
tremendous lot of people had a motive for wishing this
unfortunate lady out of the way?”</p>

<p>“The difficulty is to find anybody who hadn’t,” the
inspector agreed.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what it really does amount to. Very
confusing, considering how valuable a motive usually is.
Establish your motive and there’s your murderer, is a
pretty sound rule at Scotland Yard, I understand. Help
yourself to some more whisky, Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank you, sir,” said the inspector, and did
so. “Yes, you’re right. I can’t say I ever remember a
case when so many people had a reason, big or little,
for wishing the victim dead. Here’s luck, Mr.
Sheringham, sir!”</p>

<p>“Cheerio!” Roger returned mechanically.</p>

<p>They fell into silence. Roger realised that the
inspector, while pretending outwardly to be ready enough
to discuss the case, was in reality determined to do
nothing of the kind, at any rate so far as giving away his
own particular theory was concerned. Official reticence,
no doubt, and of course perfectly right and proper; but
distinctly galling for all that. If the inspector would
only consent to work with him frankly, Roger felt, they
really might achieve excellent results between them; as
it was, they must work apart. This professional jealousy
of the amateur was really rather petty, especially as
Roger would not insist upon any large share of the
credit for a swift and successful solution. Well, at least
he would present his rival (for such, apparently, was
what the inspector was determined to be) with no more
gratuitous clues such as that interesting scrap of paper,
that was flat!</p>

<p>In the meantime, all being fair in love and war, it
was always open to him to pick his opponent’s brains
to the best of his ability. He tried a new tack.</p>

<p>“You were asking me on the way back what I meant
by applying the word ‘imprudent’ to Mrs. Vane,” he
said with an air of ingenuous candour. “I’ll tell you.
From what I can gather about her, the lady was
anything but imprudent. She certainly married the doctor
for his money, so far as my information goes; she
cozened that extremely generous settlement out of him;
and I’m quite sure that over anything which might affect
her material welfare, imprudent is the very last thing
in the world she would be. So if she struck that boy as
being so, she was bluffing.”</p>

<p>“You mean, that she never intended to tell her
husband at all? I see. Yes, that’s my opinion too. It wouldn’t
square with my information about her either, not by
a long chalk.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you think her game was? Do you
imagine she was genuinely in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, that’s impossible to say, isn’t it? But
knowing what I do about the lady, I should say she’d
got some deeper game on than that. Something that
was going to turn out to her material welfare, as you
put it, I wouldn’t mind betting.”</p>

<p>“Of course you’ve had her past history probed into?”
Roger remarked, with careful indifference. “That’s
where you Scotland Yard people can always score over
the free-lance sleuth. Did anything interesting come to
light? I gather she was a bit of a daisy.”</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated and filled in a pause by
application to his glass. Clearly he was debating whether
any harm could be done by divulging this official secret.
In the end he decided to risk it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, wiping his moustache, “you’ll
understand that this is strictly confidential, sir, but
we <em>have</em> had a man on the job—or two or three men, for
that matter, both in London and up in the north, where
the lady originally came from; and a few very
interesting facts they were able to bring to light, too.
Nobody has the slightest idea down here, of course, but
the woman who called herself Mrs. Vane—well, she <em>was</em>
a bit of a daisy, as you say.”</p>

<p>Roger’s eyes gleamed. “What do you mean,
Inspector? <em>Called</em> herself Mrs. Vane? Wasn’t she really?”</p>

<p>The inspector did not answer the question directly.
He leaned back in his chair and puffed at his pipe for
a moment or two, then began to speak in a meditative
tone.</p>

<p>“There’s real bad blood in that family—proper
criminal stock, you might call ’em. The great-grandfather
was one of the smartest burglars we’ve ever had
in this country; they knew all about him at headquarters,
but they never caught him. He never <em>was</em> caught, in fact.
A lot of his jobs were put down later on to Charlie
Peace, but they weren’t, they were his all right; and he
was lucky, while Peace wasn’t. His son was a cut above
burglaring. The old man left him a lot of cash, and he
set up a bucket-shop in Liverpool. But he did over-reach
himself. He served one stretch of three years, and one
of five.</p>

<p>“This chap had two daughters and one son. They were
left in pretty poor circumstances, because before he
died their father managed to get rid of all the money
he’d been left and all he’d made for himself besides.
He’d managed to get rid of one of his daughters, as
well before this, however—Miss Cross’s mother, who
married an army officer and passes out of the family
history. The son was a bit of a bad egg, but he went over
to America and operated there; he’s still alive, and as
a matter of fact in prison at the moment.
Confidence-man, his little game is.</p>

<p>“The other daughter, Mrs. Vane’s mother, we’ve got
nothing particular against either. She married a
tradesman in Liverpool in a fair way of business, but ran
away with another man after she’d brought him into
the bankruptcy court by her extravagance, leaving her
child, then ten years old, behind her. Her husband
removed to London, taking the child with him, and took
a post with a firm of wholesale chemists. He died when
Mrs. Vane was seventeen, leaving nothing but debts.</p>

<p>“That left the girl a bit in the air. She got three
months for shoplifting under an assumed name soon
after her father died, and that taught her to be a bit
more careful. She went out for bigger game after that.
She was part-owner, and incidentally decoy, for a
gambling joint in the West End till the police shut it
up, and when times were hard she was usually able to
make her keep out of the sort of rich young idiot who
can be taken in by a baby face and a clinging manner—or
rich old idiot too, for that matter. However, when
she met Vane she really does seem to have been on
her uppers. Still, she took him in all right, and he went
further than all the other idiots and offered her
marriage. She played him well, one must say, because she
must have been in a blue funk all the time in case
anything came out about the sort of person she really was.
Anybody can see that the doctor’s got the very devil of
a temper, and once he found out anything it would
all be U. P.” The inspector paused and refreshed
himself with a meditative air.</p>

<p>“Go on, Inspector!” Roger cried. “I know you’re
keeping the tit-bit for the last.”</p>

<p>“Can’t put anything past you, Mr. Sheringham,”
grinned his companion. “Yes, during the war, we’ve
discovered, before she ever met Vane she went through
a form of marriage with a man called Herbert Peters.
We don’t know anything about Mr. Herbert Peters, but
we’ve been looking for him pretty hard during the last
day or two. No, we haven’t found him yet, and for all
we know he may be dead.—He might even,” the
inspector added judicially, “have been dead at the time
of her marriage to the doctor.”</p>

<p>“But you’re pretty sure he wasn’t, eh?” asked Roger
softly.</p>

<p>“I’d take my Bible oath on it!” returned the inspector
piously.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> A Midnight Expedition</h2>

<p>When the inspector had gone to bed that night,
as he did very shortly after this unprecedented outburst
of confidence, Roger sat up to await the return of
Anthony. A plan of campaign had been forming in his
mind, and he was on tenterhooks to put it into
operation.</p>

<p>Anthony made his appearance at half-past eleven, to
be greeted by his cousin with severity and heavy
sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Have you been studying the beauties of nature under
the pale crescent moon?” Roger demanded. “Don’t
attempt to deny it—you have! One of the beauties of
nature, at any rate. Well, it’s as well, I suppose, because
she certainly won’t be beautiful to-morrow under this
treatment. Her nose will be red, her eyes watery, and
she’ll be snuffling and sniffling with a streaming cold.
There’s a picture for a young lover! Will you love her
in December, Anthony, as you did in May?”</p>

<p>“Dashed funny, aren’t you?” growled the young
lover, blushing warmly. He helped himself to what the
inspector had left in the whisky-bottle.</p>

<p>“That depends on the point of view,” Roger admitted
very fairly. “<em>I</em> think I am; you don’t. It’s all a matter
of opinion.—Now, hurry up and put that inside you,
Anthony. There’s dirty work afoot for us to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night? You mean there’s something you want to
do right away?”</p>

<p>“I do; and I’ve been waiting two or three hours for
you to come in and do it with me. I want to make a
little nocturnal expedition, in circumstances of some
secrecy. To the fatal ledge, no less. You won’t need
a hat; come on. Everybody’s gone to bed, so for
Heaven’s sake try to plant your large feet down gently;
I don’t want anybody to know we’ve gone out.”</p>

<p>Obeying this injunction as well as possible, Anthony
crept after his cousin down to the back-door of the inn,
guided by the light of the latter’s torch. Roger softly
drew back the bolts, unlocked the door and pocketed
the key. They passed cautiously through.</p>

<p>“I say, where are we going, Roger?” Anthony
whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is rather exciting, isn’t it?” Roger agreed,
answering the implication of the whisper rather than
the actual words. “I told you, to the ledge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to explain a few other things first. Wait
till we’re out of this yard.”</p>

<p>As they stepped out into the highroad Roger began
to give his companion an account of the evening’s work,
describing the interview with young Woodthorpe as
accurately as he could. The recital took them half-way
across the stretch of turf, and then Anthony gave tongue.</p>

<p>“That’s the chap who did it,” said Anthony with the
utmost confidence. “Can’t you see his game? He wanted
to shut her mouth; stop her telling her husband, you
see. Seems obvious to me.”</p>

<p>“So I suppose he put a pair of female shoes on his
hands and walked along on them beside Mrs. Vane to
disguise his footmarks?” queried Roger.</p>

<p>“He could easily fake those,” Anthony returned,
unmoved by this facetiousness. “The inspector himself said
footprints were the easiest thing in the world to fake.”</p>

<p>“Within limits,” Roger demurred. “Besides, you must
remember that the letter, which looked so suspicious at
first, has rather lost its importance. I told you, it didn’t
refer to that Tuesday at all; it was for last Tuesday
fortnight.”</p>

<p>“You told me he <em>said</em> it was,” Anthony retorted
cunningly. “But he can’t prove it, can he? You’ve only got
his bare word to go on. And if he did push her over,
it seems to me he wouldn’t jib at telling you a naughty
fib or two, dear Roger.”</p>

<p>“Anthony, you overwhelm me!” Roger murmured.
“To think that such a possibility had never occurred to
my simple mind. That’s the worst of having such a
trustful nature, I always believe everything I’m told. If you
were to tell me for instance that you’d been singing the
Indian Love Lyrics to a jellyfish between the hours of
nine and eleven-thirty this evening, I should believe
you instantly.”</p>

<p>Anthony’s reply is unprintable.</p>

<p>When peace had been restored:</p>

<p>“You still haven’t told me what we’re coming here
for,” Anthony remarked.</p>

<p>They had reached the head of the nearer flight of
steps, and Roger began to descend, flashing his torch
before and behind him for the benefit of the following
Anthony. “To have a look at that cave of course,” he
replied over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“But why the hurry?”</p>

<p>“Because if we leave it till a Christian time
to-morrow,” Roger explained patiently, “Moresby will
certainly forestall us. And if there <em>is</em> anything interesting
in the way of clues to be found there, we shall decidedly
never see it, and probably never even hear of it, if we
let Moresby get there first.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Anthony.</p>

<p>They gained the ledge and made their way cautiously
along its narrow width.</p>

<p>“By the way,” Anthony remarked airily, “Margaret
was asking—that is, do you happen to know whether
that infernal inspector has still got any comic ideas
about Margaret in his head?”</p>

<p>“How the average Englishman does shirk a plain
statement of unpleasant fact,” Roger murmured. “He’d
rather use a hundred innocent words to wrap up his
perfectly obvious meaning than half-a-dozen blunt ones.
You mean, I suppose, does Moresby still think that
Margaret murdered her cousin? Well, I don’t know. I did
try to sound him, but he’s indecently reticent on the
subject. On the whole I’m inclined to think that his
ideas on that point are a little less rigid than they were.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank God the fellow’s beginning to see a
little sense at last,” was Anthony’s pious comment.</p>

<p>They progressed the rest of the way in silence, busy
with their respective thoughts.</p>

<p>“Walk carefully, Anthony,” Roger remarked as they
approached the scene of the tragedy. “We don’t want to
leave our footprints at any rate. Try to tread only on
dry rock.”</p>

<p>They picked their steps with elaborate caution.</p>

<p>Roger halted and flashed his torch round him. “This
is the spot. You haven’t been here before, have you?
That’s just about where she fell off, by that little cleft
on the edge. Now you sit down on that boulder in front
of you while I look round. We don’t want to leave more
traces than we need, and my tread is probably rather
more catlike than yours.” He began to poke about among
the crevices and loose boulders at the back of the ledge.</p>

<p>A subdued cry of triumph a few minutes later brought
Anthony to his side.</p>

<p>“This must be it,” Roger said, flashing his lamp upon
a small aperture in the cliff face, almost covered by a
large boulder. “Look!” He held his torch in the
opening.</p>

<p>By screwing his head down to the level of his knees
and peering round a corner of the boulder Anthony was
just able to make out a dim and damp interior. “Great
Scott,” he said in dismay, “I shall never be able to get
inside that.”</p>

<p>“It is going to be a struggle,” Roger admitted,
comparing his cousin’s burly bulk with the extremely small
entrance. “A certain simile concerning the eye of a
needle occurs to me with some force. Still, if friend
Colin can do it, I should say you ought to be able to.
But don’t stick half-way, or you’ll annoy the inspector
when he comes exploring. Now then, expel a deep
breath and follow Uncle Roger.” He dropped on his
hands and knees and began to worm his way inside.</p>

<p>“I can’t cope with that,” observed Anthony ruefully,
as he watched his cousin’s feet slowly and painfully
drag themselves out of his field of vision. “I’ll watch
the proceedings from the doorway.” He assumed a
recumbent position and inserted his head and a portion
of one shoulder in the tiny opening.</p>

<p>Inside was a tolerably respectable little cavern, some
ten feet wide by a dozen deep, shelving at the back till
ceiling met floor at an acute angle amid a medley of
small rocks and fragments of stone; along one side a
ledge two or three feet high and as many deep formed
a natural couch, while a large, flat boulder opposite
was equally useful as a table. Roger, standing upright
in the centre without difficulty, was throwing his light
into the various nooks and crannies with which the
irregular sides were seamed.</p>

<p>“Any luck?” Anthony asked, twisting his head at an
uncomfortable angle to improve his field of view.</p>

<p>Roger turned his light on to the floor. “There’s no
doubt the place has been used,” he said slowly; “and
used a lot. Cigarette-ends, matches, candle-ends all over
the place.” He took a couple of steps toward the back
and peered down among the rocks. “Half-a-dozen empty
chocolate boxes,” he continued, turning over his finds.
“Paper bags, sandwich wrappings, half a bun; there
doesn’t seem to be anything very exciting here.” He
began to roam round the little enclosure, examining its
possibilities with careful attention. Stooping, he picked
up half-a-dozen cigarette-stubs and scrutinised them
under his lamp. “Four gaspers and two Turkish,” he
delivered judgment, “the latter marked with pink at
the ends. Can you deduce anything from that, Anthony?
Pale ends, pink-tipped. . . . Probably Mrs. Vane
smoked them while chewing her chocolates, or,
alternatively, chewed her chocolates while smoking them—a
purely psychological distinction which certainly won’t
interest you, but in either case an abominable practice;
she seems to me to have been that kind of woman. Well,
Anthony, except so far as we confirm friend Colin’s
story, I’m very much afraid we’ve had our journey for
nothing. All these things are damp, and most of them
mildewed. I can quite believe that the place hasn’t been
used for over a fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Were you looking for anything in particular?”</p>

<p>“No, just hoping against hope.” He bent and peered
into a cavity in one of the sides. “Half-a-dozen banana
skins and the remains of an orange. Not very helpful.
How very hungry this place seems to have made those
two! Well, I suppose we’d better be getting back.”</p>

<p>“What’s this thing just in front of me?” Anthony
asked suddenly. “Bit of newspaper or something. No,
you can’t see it from where you’re standing. Behind
that big flat rock on your left.”</p>

<p>Roger retrieved the article in question. “A copy
of <i>London Opinion</i>,” he replied without very much
interest. “That would be Master Colin’s property, I
should imagine; not the lady’s. Issue dated— Why,
hullo!”</p>

<p>“What?” Anthony asked eagerly.</p>

<p>Roger paused and made a rapid mental calculation.
“Good for you, Anthony!” he exclaimed. “Do you
know what this is? It’s last Saturday’s number!”</p>

<p>“Oho!” observed Anthony with interest.</p>

<p>Roger stared at him. “So Colin was not telling the
truth after all!” he exclaimed softly.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve been trying to din into you
all the time,” kindly pointed out his cousin.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch14">

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br> Roger Is Argumentative</h2>

<p>Roger dabbled his bare foot in the wave which
surged past the rock upon which he and Anthony were
sitting. Lifting it out of the water, he contemplated
his dripping toes with apparently deep interest. “Of
course,” he said slowly, “we must remember that
Colin <em>may</em> have been telling the truth, after all.”</p>

<p>“How can he have been?” demanded his cousin.</p>

<p>It was after breakfast on the following morning. On
the plea that business was business and that if he was
to be any use in this affair at all Anthony must
temporarily divest himself of the rôle of interesting young
lover and assume that of the idiot friend, Roger had
managed to restrain his cousin from making a
hopeful bee-line, immediately his last mouthful had been
swallowed, along the top of the cliffs in the direction
of a certain small grassy ledge just below their
summit. With tactlessly patent reluctance Anthony had
been persuaded to bring his after-breakfast pipe down
to the sea level, where Roger had insisted upon
scrambling out to the very farthest rock which remained
unsubmerged in order, as he carefully explained, to
obtain the necessary privacy for airing his theories. There
he had immediately removed his shoes and socks and
proceeded to paddle.</p>

<p>Making the best of a bad business, Anthony had
watched with a cold eye his cousin’s undignified
behaviour and unhesitatingly refused to follow such
infantile deportment.</p>

<p>“How can Woodthorpe have been telling the truth?”
he repeated, as Roger showed signs of being less
interested in his question than in a limpet which was
sturdily countering all his efforts to dislodge it from its
native rock. “That copy of <i>London Opinion</i> clinches that.
If the inspector’s got any sense at all, he’ll draw the
same deduction from it as we did and arrest the
fellow right away, before he bolts.”</p>

<p>Roger abandoned the limpet with a slight sigh. “But
supposing, Anthony, that it wasn’t Woodthorpe who
left it there at all?” he said patiently. “Hadn’t that
occurred to you?”</p>

<p>“No, it hadn’t,” Anthony returned, not without scorn.
“It’s so dashed likely, isn’t it? You said yourself that
it couldn’t have been Mrs. Vane. Who else could it
have been?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Roger thoughtfully. “Who, indeed?” He
withdrew his feet from the water and, hunching his
knees, clasped his hands round them and stared out to
sea. “Now just let’s see, for the sake of argument, what
we can deduce from that copy of <i>London Opinion</i>, shall
we? Forgetting for the moment all about Woodthorpe,
I mean, and our slight complex about his veracity.
Shall we do that, Anthony?”</p>

<p>“Fire ahead, then,” replied his cousin resignedly.</p>

<p>“Well in the first place, and confining ourselves to
bare probabilities, with every likelihood of error, who
constitute the majority of <i>London Opinion’s</i> public,
would you say? Men. That’s why I advanced the
unlikelihood of Mrs. Vane having left it there; it doesn’t
sound to me at all the type of paper that we might
expect to find Mrs. Vane reading. Besides, she’s much
more likely to have brought a novel. Do you agree, so
far?”</p>

<p>Anthony grunted.</p>

<p>“Very well, then; in all probability that paper was
left there some time since last Saturday morning, by
a man. Now what <em>type</em> of man reads <i>London Opinion?</i>
Not the upper classes; they read <i>Punch</i>. Not the lower
classes either. The middle classes—upper, middle and
lower middle-classes. Our man, therefore, was probably
an upper, middle or lower middle-class man. Now that
doesn’t sound very much like the son of Sir Henry
Woodthorpe, does it?”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to make out that just because a chap’s
father is a baronet, he never reads <i>London Opinion?</i>”
enquired Anthony with some sarcasm.</p>

<p>“No, Anthony, I am not. You tend to miss my point.
What I am very brilliantly endeavouring to convey to
your moss-covered intelligence is that if Mr. Colin
Woodthorpe, son of Sir Henry Woodthorpe, Bart.,
wanted to take a piece of literature with which to amuse
himself while waiting for the other half of an
appointment he’d probably take the <i>Sporting Life</i>, <i>Punch</i>, or a
detective novel. That he might very nearly as well have
taken <i>London Opinion</i> I readily admit, but only very
nearly. What I’m considering, in fact, is the balance
of probabilities. Now are you there?”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that the chap, whoever he
was, did take it to amuse himself with while waiting
for an appointment? How do you know there was an
appointment at all?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, bandicoot,” Roger returned with exemplary
patience. “But do you imagine (a) that he took it to
read <em>during</em> the appointment, fearing lest he should
be bored by the lady’s idle prattle; or (b) that he went
down to that ledge all alone and crept into that cave
for the sole purpose of reading <i>London Opinion</i> in the
dark?”</p>

<p>“He might just as well have simply happened to have
it with him, and chucked it away because he couldn’t
be bothered to carry it home again.”</p>

<p>“He might,” Roger agreed at once; “but it isn’t
nearly so likely. No, on the balance of probabilities I
think we may assume that this man, probably not
Woodthorpe, probably took <i>London Opinion</i> with him to read
on the ledge while waiting for the other half of a
probable appointment in that cave. He might have thrown
it away then and there as soon as she turned up, but
with that instinctive inhibition which most of us have
against throwing something away with which we have
not completely finished, he took it with him into the
cave when the lady arrived and then, as you say, left
it there because he couldn’t be bothered to take it home
again—psychologically speaking, there is a large
difference between throwing a thing away and leaving it
behind. And we know the lady <em>did</em> turn up, dear little
Anthony, because otherwise he wouldn’t have gone into
the cave at all, but would have continued to sit outside
where he could see to read. Are you with me?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Now who was the other half of this man’s
appointment?” Roger continued in argumentative tones.
“Personally, I’m putting my money on Mrs. Vane. As far as
friend Colin knew nobody but himself and Mrs. Vane
had any inkling about that cave. He discovered it
himself, he told us, about a year ago, and was at once
struck with its suitability for the purpose to which he
afterward put it. He was quite positive that he, at
any rate, had told nobody else of its existence. To
sum up then—if Colin is telling the truth all through,
Mrs. Vane herself arranged an appointment with an
unknown man belonging to the middle classes for some
time since last Saturday morning, to discuss business
of an obviously secret and confidential nature. And to
stretch a point, we’ll add that that appointment
resulted in her death, and that the unknown middle-class
man is her murderer.—And how is all that,” Roger
concluded with legitimate pride, “out of just finding a copy
of <i>London Opinion</i> in that little cave, eh?”</p>

<p>“So now I should think you’d better go off and talk
it all over with Moresby,” said Anthony hopefully.</p>

<p>“Anthony, you disgust me. Do you or do you not
want to help me save your young woman from the
gallows? No, don’t trouble to reply to that question; it’s
a rhetorical one. You do. Very well, then. Continue, if
you please, to sustain the part of idiot friend which you
play so admirably.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want me to do?” Anthony asked
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Listen to me while I clarify my own ideas, somewhat
nebulous at the moment, by putting them into speech.
Let me go on examining possibilities. Though by the
way, since embarking on this one-sided discussion I find
I appear to have converted myself on one point. I
do <em>not</em> believe it was Colin Woodthorpe who left that copy
of <i>London Opinion</i> in the cave. What have you got to
say about that?”</p>

<p>“You made out a pretty useful case against it,”
Anthony was forced to admit.</p>

<p>“Yes; I did. On grounds of pure reason I reject Colin
as our unknown man, but I can easily find that out for
certain; I’ve got a little test in mind for him, which I
propose to apply as soon as I leave you. Well, now,
assuming Colin is out of it, can we find anybody else to
take his place? Think hard.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, though,” Anthony said after a little
pause. “Aren’t you forgetting those foot-prints? You’ve
been saying all the time that it must have been a woman
with Mrs. Vane, not a man. How does that square in
with this idea?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not forgetting them. They can be worked
into this theory all right. If we assume, you see, that
the murder was a premeditated one, as I think it
certainly was, we can assume also that the murderer took
a few elementary precautions to throw the police off
his track if ever anything turned up to make them
suspicious about the accident theory. Well, supposing that
Mrs. Vane arrived alone, as we now think she must
have done, what would be easier for the man than to
put on a pair of female shoes he’d brought with him
for the purpose, go a little way along the ledge and then
walk back again beside Mrs. Vane’s tracks, carefully
making prints wherever he could and modifying his
stride to suit her smaller steps? That’s perfectly feasible.
Footprints and how to fake them are about the first thing
to which your amateur murderer would turn his
attention.”</p>

<p>“Cunning,” commented Anthony.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but perfectly intelligible. Well now,
having disposed of that point, let’s get back to where we
were before. Can you think of anyone else to take
young Woodthorpe’s place as the villain of the piece?”</p>

<p>Anthony ruminated. “The only other men in any way
mixed up in the show seem to be Dr. Vane and
Russell.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. And that doesn’t help us much, does it? Dr.
Vane we can wash out right away; there’s no
conceivable reason why a wife should want to make an
appointment in an out-of-the-way and thoroughly uncomfortable
place with her own husband when she can much better
interview him from her own drawing-room sofa. But
Russell—! What does Russell give us?”</p>

<p>“If she <em>had</em> been carrying on an intrigue with him as
well as Woodthorpe,” Anthony murmured.</p>

<p>Roger shifted his position so that he could plunge
both his legs in the water up to their knees. “Ah, that’s
better. You’re missing a lot, Anthony, if you only knew
it, by being so proud and superior; superior people
always do.—Yes, that’s perfectly true. Russell would
then have almost exactly the same motive for getting
rid of her as Colin had, wouldn’t he? Jealous wife
instead of jealous unknown fiancée (I wonder who friend
Colin <em>is</em> meditating an engagement with, by the way,
if Moresby’s right. It ought to be easy enough to find
out), <em>plus</em> fear of jealous husband’s righteous wrath
possibly into the bargain, if she’d been trying the same
bluff on with him too. But that does make the lady a
little—how shall I put it?—<em>promiscuous</em>, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think she’d stick at that,” said Anthony
sagely.</p>

<p>“Oh, nor should I. Not for a moment. Especially if
she’d got a little game on with both of them, to her own
ultimate advantage. But if that were the case, I can’t
help thinking it somewhat imprudent to meet them both
in the same very compromising spot. <em>That</em> doesn’t sound
like Mrs. Vane at all to me.”</p>

<p>“But she <em>did</em> meet the second man in the same place
for all that,” Anthony pointed out, “whether it was
Russell or not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true enough. Of course, this may have
been an isolated assignation, made with the knowledge
that Colin would be busy at that time elsewhere. But
Colin hasn’t an alibi for the time of Mrs. Vane’s death,
we discovered, whereas the inspector says that Russell
himself has, a cast-iron one. No, it’s a pure guess of
mine, Anthony, but I feel instinctively that this
mysterious man is somebody who hasn’t cropped up in the
case at all yet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s rather vague. And you haven’t the
slightest notion who it could be?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have,” Roger replied thoughtfully. “Just the
slightest notion. It’s my opinion that this man will prove
to be somebody out of Mrs. Vane’s murky past. Quite
possibly her real husband.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s an idea,” Anthony concurred with
enthusiasm. “Good for you, Roger!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Anthony,” Roger returned gratefully.</p>

<p>They discussed this interesting possibility for a short
time, and then Roger began to put on his shoes and
socks.</p>

<p>“I think that’s really all there is to go into at
present,” he said, “so you can have leave of absence for the
rest of the morning. You can tell Margaret about our
discovery last night and this new visitor Mrs. Vane may
have had recently. With any luck she ought to be able to
give us a pointer to the gent.”</p>

<p>Anthony rose to his feet. “If I happen to see her, I
will,” he said a little stiffly.</p>

<p>“ ‘If I happen to see her, I will!’ ” Roger scoffed.
“Oh, very good, Anthony; very good indeed. I must try
you with the butter test at lunch. If half-a-pound of
butter, placed in the patient’s mouth, shows no sign of
melting within⸺”</p>

<p>“What are <em>you</em> going to do?” Anthony asked
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’ve got to be busy. I’ve got to lay my
trap for young Colin first of all; then I want to have
a word with Moresby and hear exactly what he’s made
of that <i>London Opinion</i>, if anything (he’s probably
concealing it from me in his breast-pocket at this very
moment); and lastly I want to tackle this business of the
mysterious stranger from the other end. I’m going to
cross-examine every inhabitant of the place within a
square mile of that ledge to try and find someone who
was within sight of it early on Tuesday afternoon. I’m
convinced I’m on the right tack; if Margaret can’t help
us, I’m going to exhaust the possibilities of that line of
information if it takes me a month.”</p>

<p>“But I thought everybody had been questioned about
that already?”</p>

<p>“Not so,” Roger replied cunningly. “They were
questioned before about seeing Mrs. Vane. There was no
word mentioned about a strange man.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Anthony, balancing irresolutely on each
foot in turn. “Yes, that’s a sound scheme.—Well, I’ll
be strolling along now, I think, if you don’t want me
any more.”</p>

<p>Roger waved a paternal farewell with an Oxford
brogue.</p>

<p>After Anthony had departed Roger did not follow him
immediately. For quite a long time he sat on his rock,
oblivious of the fact that other and even tempting ones
were being uncovered by the receding tide straight in
front of him. This talk with Anthony certainly had
clarified his ideas very considerably—had, indeed,
presented him with some highly interesting brand-new ones.
The case had suddenly taken on an entirely different
aspect. From being merely complex it had become
downright complicated. He wondered what Inspector
Moresby, with his very much more conventional
methods, would have to say about his deductions from that
copy of <i>London Opinion</i>, a piece of constructive
reasoning which Roger had not the slightest hesitation in
characterising in his own mind as brilliant.</p>

<p>There are some people who are said to know
instinctively whether they are in the right or wrong,
without the aid of any extraneous evidence. Roger had
not the least doubt that he possessed this sixth sense,
and as he rose at last to his feet and began his scramble
back to the foot of the cliffs every instinct was busy
telling him that he had got his finger poised above the very
heart of the problem. In some new actor, not yet
appeared on the stage, would the ultimate solution be
found. To lay his hands on him should only prove a
matter of time and patience.</p>

<p>Humming blithely, he clambered up the uneven
ascent and hoisted himself on the ledge. Well, first of all
he would have to⸺</p>

<p>“Ah, <em>there</em> you are, Mr. Sheringham! Do you know,
I had quite an idea I should find you here. I’ve been
so anxious to see you again, after our very brief
conversation yesterday morning. I want to ask you what
you think of this terrible crime in our midst, and
whether you have formed a theory yet. I hope—I do
so hope it will not prove to have been committed by—ah,
dear me, a terrible affair!”</p>

<p>Roger wheeled about. From above a boulder at the
back of the ledge a face like that of a benign and
beardless goat was regarding him benevolently through an
enormous pair of horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” confided Roger Sheringham to his
immortal soul.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br> Interesting Discovery of a Shoe</h2>

<p>It was past noon when Roger made his
appearance at the little grassy ledge. To his surprise he found
it occupied by only one tenant, who was lying on his
back and staring up into the blue sky, puffing
contentedly at his pipe. Roger scrambled down the little slope
and dropped on to the turf beside his cousin.</p>

<p>“How now, fair coz? What have you done with the
lady? I wanted a word with her.”</p>

<p>Anthony turned his head. “You can hardly expect
her to be at your beck and call <em>all</em> the time,” he
observed with some severity. “You know she’s keeping
house for the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Anthony,” Roger replied meekly. “Is she
keeping house now?”</p>

<p>“She’s gone into the village to do some shopping.
She’ll be coming back here when she’s through.”</p>

<p>“A proper little gent,” remarked Roger, pulling out
his own pipe and filling it lazily, “a proper little gent,
such as I could wish any cousin of mine to be, would
have gone with her and carried her parcels for her.”</p>

<p>Anthony flushed slightly. “She wouldn’t let me, damn
you. She said that— She wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s quite right,” Roger admitted handsomely.
“Villages <em>are</em> appalling places for gossip, aren’t they?”
He concealed his grin in the operation of applying a
match to his pipe.</p>

<p>“Did you have any luck?” Anthony asked hastily.</p>

<p>“Well, yes and no.” His cousin’s leg successfully
stretched, Roger was ready enough to revert to the main
theme. “First of all I was waylaid by that wretched
little parson, whose curiosity strikes me as being really
indecent. He tried his best to pump me as to what I
thought about it all, what the inspector thought about
it all, whether any arrest was imminent, whether any
other clues had been discovered, and all the rest of it,
and though I’m afraid I was outrageously rude to him
in my frantic efforts to get away, he managed to waste
a perfectly good quarter-of-an-hour of my valuable
time; finally I told him that a Bible and prayer-book
marked with the initials ‘S. M.’ had been found on the
ledge close to where the tragedy had taken place, and
the police were looking for the owner. While he was
still gasping, I effected my get-away.”</p>

<p>“You are an ass, Roger,” grinned Anthony.</p>

<p>“So it may seem to you,” Roger replied blandly. “In
reality I am a person of remarkable astuteness and
cunning. Well, then I went back to the inn, borrowed mine
host’s bicycle and headed for Clouston Hall. I don’t
mind walking it in the cool of the evening, but I was
hanged if I was going to do so in the middle of a day
like this. All fell out as arranged.”</p>

<p>“You mean, Woodthorpe’s cleared?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Luckily he was at home, and I pretended I
wanted to clear up a minor point arising out of our
conversation last night. If I must be forced to admit it, I’m
afraid I took the inspector’s name in vain. Then, by
subtle and extremely cunning degrees, I led the
conversation round till I could quote the best illustrated
joke in that issue of <i>London Opinion</i>, having been at
some pains previously to buy a copy and study it. I
quoted the first half of the joke only, and if friend
Colin had seen the paper he couldn’t possibly have
failed to remember it—but he couldn’t supply the point. <i lang="la">Ergo</i>,
Colin had not seen that issue of <i>London Opinion;</i> <i lang="la">ergo</i>,
Colin could not have been the person to have
left it in the cave.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he saw through you?”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure he didn’t. Colin is not a young man
who impressed me as teeming with intelligence, and of
course I was on the alert for any signs of bluff. He
was perfectly natural. No, I’m sure Colin isn’t our
man. Now it’s your turn to report. Could Margaret give
you any useful information? You had time to tell her
our conclusions to date, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I told her, but she couldn’t remember anything
about a strange visitor to Mrs. Vane. She said she’d
rack her brains on the way to the village and back,
but she couldn’t think of one off-hand.”</p>

<p>“I see. And when do you expect her back?”</p>

<p>Anthony consulted his wrist-watch. “Any time now.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then let us recline on our backs, close our
eyes and indulge in blessed silence till she comes,
because certainly we shan’t get any when she does.” He
proceeded to suit his action to his words.</p>

<p>Anthony regarded his horizontal cousin with a large
grin. “ ‘<em>Blessed</em> silence!’ ” he scoffed “Oh, very good,
Roger; very good indeed. I must try you with the butter
test at lunch. If half-a-pound of butter, placed in the
patient’s mouth—how does it go on, eh?”</p>

<p>But Roger, serenely recumbent, took refuge in his
blessed silence.</p>

<p>During the next ten minutes not a single word was
spoken. Then Margaret appeared, and Roger’s
Trappist-like vow was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>“Now then, Margaret,” he said briskly, when
greetings were over and they were all seated once more.
“Now then, it’s up to you. Anthony tells me he’s given
you an account of my activities. Have you got any
information for me yet?”</p>

<p>“You mean, about the mysterious visitor?” said the
girl, wrinkling her white forehead. “No, I’m afraid I
haven’t. Elsie never had a mysterious visitor at all, to
my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“And yet you said before that you thought there was
someone or something she was afraid of,” Roger mused.
“That doesn’t help you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” Margaret confessed. “I couldn’t
say anything definite about that when you asked me
before, you remember.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Anthony suddenly, “are you sure
she was <em>afraid?</em> Not just worried? If she was just
worried, you see, that chap Woodthorpe would account for
it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a good point,” Roger approved. “Whether
she had any deep game on with him or not, she’d
naturally be put out by his wanting to break with her. Is
that more like it, Margaret?”</p>

<p>“It might have been that of course,” said the girl
doubtfully, “but—oh, I don’t know, but my impression
certainly is that it was something stronger than just
worry.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” Roger said cheerfully. “That
confirms my theory. If it <em>was</em> somebody out of her past,
trying in all probability to blackmail her, she certainly
would show signs of fear.”</p>

<p>“I know!” Margaret exclaimed. “I could go through
her things, couldn’t I? Letters and papers, I mean. I
could easily do that, and I should think if there is
anything to be found out that’s the most likely way of
discovering it.”</p>

<p>“I should say the inspector is almost certain to have
done that already,” Roger meditated. “Still, there’s no
harm in your doing it too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hadn’t thought of that,” said Margaret, her
face falling. “Then it won’t be much use?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it. Still, we mustn’t disregard the possibility.
Of course if you could find some place that the
inspector may have overlooked—! Documentary evidence of
that sort, you see, would be hidden very carefully away
by a person of Mrs. Vane’s criminal—shall we
say?—training. And after all, the inspector wouldn’t have been
looking for anything like that. Probably he’ll only have
glanced through the obvious, merely as a matter of
routine.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope for the best,” Margaret smiled.
“Anyhow, if I don’t find something I promise you it
won’t be for want of looking.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Roger, dismissing this topic,
“how’s Dr. Vane?”</p>

<p>“George? Oh, he’s all right. Why?”</p>

<p>“I only wondered. No interesting developments yet?”</p>

<p>Margaret laughed. “You mean Miss Williamson?
Oh, give her time. I don’t think any woman could be
expected to propose to a man in less than a week from his
wife’s death, really.”</p>

<p>“Roger judges everybody by himself,” interposed
Anthony maliciously.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going so far as to suggest that she’d
actually proposed to him yet, Margaret,” Roger explained
mildly. “I was just asking whether there’d been any
developments, of any sort.”</p>

<p>“If there have been, then, I don’t know them. I hardly
ever see either of them in these days. They seem to be
spending more time in the laboratory than ever.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I personally should care to
conduct my courtship in an atmosphere of test-tubes,
litmus-paper, and dead rabbits, but there’s no
accounting for tastes. A dead rabbit, I feel convinced, would put
me off my stroke altogether.”</p>

<p>“Roger, you’re disgusting. Well, is there anything
else you want to ask me?”</p>

<p>“Not at the moment. I’ll wait for one of your more
helpful days. Does that mean, by the way, that
‘Good-morning, Mr. Sheringham. It’s been so nice to see
you. You must come again some day’? Because if so, I
warn you that Anthony comes with me.”</p>

<p>“Roger, I think you’re being perfectly horrid this
morning,” exclaimed Miss Cross, blushing warmly.</p>

<p>“Shall I chuck <em>him</em> over the cliff for you, Margaret?”
suggested Anthony, no less moist.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t mean anything of the sort,” Margaret went
on, disregarding this admirable offer. “I was simply
going to say that if you don’t want to discuss things with
me any more, I wish you’d show me the little cave where
Elsie and Colin used to meet. It sounds most thrilling.”</p>

<p>“What I deplore most of all in the young women of
to-day,” remarked Roger sadly, as he rose with
reluctance to his feet, “is the unpleasing morbidity of their
tastes.”</p>

<p>As they walked abreast along the top of the cliff,
Roger’s thoughts were busy round a certain point.
Margaret’s reference to her dead cousin as Dr. Vane’s wife
tended to show that Anthony had not told her that the
two were probably not legally married. Roger was glad
of this; he had meant to warn Anthony that morning
to say nothing to the girl on this delicate matter, but it
had slipped his memory. Until the matter was settled
one way or the other, either by the discovery of the
living Herbert Peters or by the establishment of his death
prior to Mrs. Vane’s marriage to the doctor, it was much
better to leave the girl in ignorance of the issues
involved. For (and this was the point which was really
worrying Roger) if Mrs. Vane’s second marriage turned
out to be a bigamous one, would that not mean that the
settlement was invalidated and Margaret’s legacy
vanished into thin air? Without knowing the exact terms of
the document it was impossible to say, but Roger meant
to go into the matter with a solicitor on Margaret’s
behalf at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>His attention was recalled to the present moment with
a jerk. “I can’t tell you how thankful I was to hear of
this new theory of yours, Roger,” Margaret was saying
with an effort of lightness. “It’s such a change
from—well, from the way things seem to have been heading.
And you really think you’ll be able to substantiate it?”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure I shall, my dear,” Roger replied,
perhaps with more confidence than he actually felt at the
moment. “I’ve what is termed, I understand, a hunch
about it. Don’t you worry any more; Uncle Roger is
going to see you through this and get to the bottom of it
for you.”</p>

<p>“I shall never be able to thank you enough if you do,”
the girl said in a low tone. “Perhaps you can imagine
something of the nightmare the last day or two has
been, since I realised that I—that they—” Her voice
broke.</p>

<p>Roger drew her arm through his and patted her hand
paternally. “That’s all over now, my dear. No need to
worry about that again. Uncle Roger’s on the job now.
Besides,” he went on, instinctively shying away from
any such display of feeling, “to touch on lesser matters,
I believe I can promise you that even the inspector is
giving up that theory now too.”</p>

<p>“He is?” Margaret did not attempt to conceal her joy.
She looked at Roger with shining eyes. “He is really?
Did he tell you so?”</p>

<p>“Well, not in so many words,” hedged Roger, who
had not the least solid ground for this assertion. “But
he meant me to infer it, I think. He’s a very cautious
bird, though, and would never say anything outright.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank Heaven!” Margaret murmured. “At last I
can begin to breathe again!”</p>

<p>Anthony glared at the horizon and muttered beneath
his breath. The words “damfool,” “anointed ass” and
“tommyrot” were indistinctly audible.</p>

<p>The rest of the way Margaret seemed to dance on air,
and Roger rejoiced openly with her. Even Anthony was
so far infected by the general feeling as to forget his
dark broodings regarding the inspector’s state of
anointed asininity and possess himself of Margaret’s
other arm. It was a singularly hot day, but Margaret
did not appear to mind the extra burden in the least.
Perhaps she liked having her arms carried for her.</p>

<p>They reached the nearer flight of steps and descended
to the ledge.</p>

<p>“I’ve only been down here once since Elsie’s death,”
Margaret remarked, as they made their way along it in
single file with Roger in the van. “I’m not even sure
whereabouts she—where it happened.”</p>

<p>“Just along there, it was,” Roger said, pointing ahead
of them. “You see where the ledge broadens out for
twenty or thirty yards. Just in the middle of that.
The little cave’s there too.”</p>

<p>As they arrived at the spot where the ledge began to
widen Margaret stopped and peered over the edge. Down
below the waves were thrashing and beating, with a
sullen roar and a seething of white foam, among the huge
boulders. She shuddered.</p>

<p>“How—how <em>horrible!</em>” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Roger had waited for her and she walked slowly on,
but still gazing down into the turmoil as if fascinated.
Anthony watched her with a nameless anxiety: there <em>were</em>
people (weren’t there?) who got a bit rocky on
heights and as often as not threw themselves over from
sheer fascinated funk. “Better not walk so near the
edge, Margaret,” he called out to her above the roar of
the waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped short and stared down among
the rocks, leaning perilously over; it seemed as if
something had riveted her attention.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” she asked Roger, pointing a slim
forefinger. “Isn’t there something on that big greeny rock,
just out of the water? It looks like a—yes, it’s a shoe,
surely.”</p>

<p>Roger followed the direction she indicated. “Yes,” he
agreed. “It’s an old shoe, I think. There must be a good
man— Hullo, wait a minute!” He stood for an instant
staring down, frowning. “Shin down and get it, Anthony,
will you?” he said abruptly the next moment. “You’re
younger than I am. I’ve got an idea.”</p>

<p>“You have?” Margaret asked eagerly, as Anthony
hastened to obey. “What?”</p>

<p>“Half a minute, till I’ve had a look at it.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Roger was turning the shoe over in
his hands. It was a lady’s, size six, soaked with
sea-water and in a dilapidated condition; the buckle had
been torn off, and the leather was slit on either side of
the toe down to the sole.</p>

<p>Roger’s eyes gleamed. “Eureka!” he exclaimed softly.
“Good for your sharp eyes, lady. You understand what
this is, both of you, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Roger!” Margaret cried. “Do explain! I don’t know
what it is, except an old shoe. What is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s one of the shoes worn by the murderer to
disguise his foot-prints, precisely as I said,” Roger
explained, with a not unjustified triumph. “Don’t you see
why the leather’s cut like this? To enable the shoe to
be crammed on to a foot several sizes too large for it.
He had the pair all ready with him, made use of them,
and then threw them down into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Jolly good, Roger!” Anthony exclaimed, smiting his
cousin on the back in his exuberance. “Then you were
right when you said the murderer was a man.”</p>

<p>“I was, Anthony; and this clinches it once and for all.
No woman would want to make a shoe this size still
larger to fit her foot. I shall have to hare off and see the
inspector about this. In the meantime, you shin down
again and hunt among those rocks for the second one;
it’s bound to be somewhere about. Children, this is the
biggest thing that’s happened since I took up the case!”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br> Inspector Moresby Intervenes</h2>

<p>“The biggest thing that’s happened since you
took up the case, is it, sir?” said a voice behind them.
“Well, well, that’s interesting. May I have a look at that
shoe?”</p>

<p>They wheeled round, startled. Then Anthony glared,
Margaret stiffened and Roger grinned.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Inspector!” cried the last. “Where in the
world did you spring from?”</p>

<p>“The cave, sir,” the inspector replied, a little twinkle
in his blue eyes, as he possessed himself of the shoe.
“Though not so much sprung as crawled.” He turned
the shoe over in his hand, examining it with professional
intentness.</p>

<p>“Find anything interesting in the cave, by the way?”
Roger asked airily.</p>

<p>The inspector glanced up from the shoe, his twinkle
again to the fore. “Only what you did, I fancy, Mr.
Sheringham, sir,” he replied blandly. “A copy
of <i>London Opinion</i>, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you found that as interesting as I did,”
Roger returned, somewhat discomfited.</p>

<p>Anthony had been watching this exchange without
joy. When one has been anointed ass enough to suspect,
on grounds of mere material evidence, a particularly
high-souled young woman, it would only be decent, to
Anthony’s mind, on finding one’s self confronted with
the said high-souled young woman at least to exhibit
signs of uncontrollable embarrassment and gloom. Yet
so far from exhibiting any such signs, the inspector had
completely ignored the high-souled young woman’s
existence. Things like that were simply not done.</p>

<p>“I expect you’d probably like to be getting back now,”
said Anthony to the high-souled young woman, in tones
of frigid correctness. “May I see you home?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, that is very kind of you,” replied the
high-souled young woman no less stiffly.</p>

<p>They turned and walked, like two faintly animated
ramrods, back the way they had come.</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby must have been singularly devoid
of all sensibility; even this pointed behaviour failed to
move him to any exhibition of remorse. “You’re quite
right, Mr. Sheringham, sir,” he observed, inhumanly
unconscious of the censure conveyed in every line of the
dignified retreating figures. “This <em>is</em> interesting, this
shoe. I’ll send a man down some time to look for its
fellow. Now sit down and tell me all about it. What
made you think that the murderer is a man, and what
had that copy of <i>London Opinion</i> got to tell <em>you?</em>”</p>

<p>Now it had certainly been no part of Roger’s plans to
give the inspector, for the time being at any rate, any
idea of his new theory. Beyond reporting to him, as in
duty bound, the discovery of that significant shoe, he
was going to say nothing of the deductions he had been
able to draw from it. The inspector himself had chosen
to establish a rivalry between them, and Roger had
not been slow to accept the challenge. Yet in a quarter
of an hour’s time, by a judicious mixture of flattery,
cajolery and officialism, the inspector had succeeded in
scooping from Roger’s mind every thought that had
passed through it during the last twelve hours, together
with the full story of his activities for that period. It
was not for nothing that Inspector Moresby had reached
the heights he now adorned.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll not say you’re on the wrong tack, sir,” he
observed cautiously, when Roger had hung the last bow
and tied the final ribbon about his newly decorated
theory. “I’ll not say I think you’re on the wrong tack,
though I won’t say I think you’re on the right one either.
The reasoning’s clever, and though it’s easy enough for
me to pick holes in it, it’s just as easy for you to fill ’em
up again. The thing’s too vague to say either way just
yet.”</p>

<p>“I made a perfectly legitimate set of deductions, and
I’ve just had them confirmed in a rather remarkable
way,” Roger insisted not altogether too pleased with this
hardly exuberant praise of his efforts.</p>

<p>“That’s quite right,” the inspector agreed soothingly.
“But the trouble is, you see, that in a case like this when
the known facts are so precious few, it’s possible to make
half-a-dozen sets of deductions from them, all quite
different. For instance,” he went on with a paternal air
which Roger found somewhat hard to bear, “for instance
I’ve no doubt that if you gave me time, I could prove to
you, just as conclusively as you’ve proved your own
theory, that the real murderer is the doctor’s
secretary—(what’s her name?) Miss Williamson.”</p>

<p>“Miss Williamson?” Roger echoed, startled out of
his mild annoyance. “Good Heavens, I never thought
seriously of her. You don’t really think⸺?”</p>

<p>“I do not, sir,” the inspector smiled. “Not for one
minute. I can’t say it ever entered my mind before.
But—wait a minute!” He thought rapidly for a moment,
still smiling. “How’s this? Miss Williamson’s setting her
cap at the doctor,—” Roger caught his breath and
looked at the other narrowly, but the inspector returned
his gaze with bland innocence “—but knows she can’t
get him, or <em>thinks</em> of course that she can’t get him, till
Mrs. Vane’s out of the way. You’ve seen the lady, and
you probably gathered as well as I did that if Miss
Williamson makes up her mind to a thing, that thing’s
going to happen. She strolled over from the house to
the top of the cliffs that Tuesday afternoon to get a
breath of air, and sees Mrs. Vane making for the
Russells’ house, alone; not a soul in sight. ‘Here’s my
opportunity!’ she says, joins Mrs. Vane and easily
persuades her, on some pretext or other, to accompany her
down to the ledge; and there all she’s got to do is to
push her over. That fits the facts all right, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But was Miss Williamson out that afternoon?”
Roger asked shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” said the inspector, with an air of mild
surprise. “Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“No,” Roger had to admit. “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. She went out just as I said, for a breath of
air. It was a hot afternoon and the laboratory got a bit
stuffy. She was on the top of the cliffs for about
half-an-hour, and says she saw nobody. It was a bit before the
time of the murder, but we’ve only got her word for
that. If nobody saw her go out and nobody saw her come
in, how are we to know she’s telling the truth? I tried
to get some confirmation of her statement from the
doctor, but he’s as vague as you like. Might have been the
morning, so far as he remembers. Besides, he wasn’t in
the laboratory all the afternoon himself; I got that from
the maid who took his tea in to him there; he wasn’t
there then.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about the coat-button? How is that going
to fit in?”</p>

<p>“On her way down the drive,” responded the inspector
glibly, “Miss Williamson noticed a coat-button lying
on the ground. She recognized it as one of Miss Cross’s,
and being a precise, careful sort of person, picked it up
and slipped it into her pocket, meaning to give it to Miss
Cross later. After the murder, however, she says to
herself: ‘Well, there’s nothing to beat a murder that looks
like an accident, but I’ll just make sure that if anybody <em>is</em>
going to be suspected it shan’t be me!’ and with that
she climbs down to where the body’s lying (she’s a
strong, active-looking woman, so that wouldn’t give her
overmuch difficulty) and puts the button in the dead
woman’s hand. As for the footprints, they might just
as well have been made by her as anyone else.”</p>

<p>“Very neat,” said Roger approvingly. “And the shoes,
eh? What about them?”</p>

<p>The inspector laid one finger along the side of his
nose and rubbed that organ slowly; his eyes began to
twinkle again. “Ah! Well, I can think of several ways
of working those shoes in, sir, and I’ve no doubt you
can do the same.”</p>

<p>“Meaning that you’ve already made an interesting
deduction or two from them, about which you’re
determined to keep as tight as a clam?” Roger laughed.
“All right, don’t be frightened; I won’t try to open
you.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go so far as to say that, sir,” returned
the inspector guardedly, and left the implication of his
words tactfully vague. “Anyhow, Mr. Sheringham,”
he went on the next moment, “you see how it is. It’s easy
enough to twist the facts, when they’re so few, into
meaning exactly what we want them to mean, and away
from meaning exactly what we don’t want them to mean.
It’s only in those detective stories, where the inspector
from Scotland Yard always shows up so badly, that
there’s only one inference drawn from a set of facts
(not one fact, I’m meaning; a set) and that’s invariably
the right one. The fact of the matter is, sir,” the
inspector added in a burst of confidence, “that what I
said about Miss Williamson might just as well apply to
anyone. Given the motive in this case, <em>anybody</em> might
have done it!”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” Roger agreed ruefully. “Heaven
knows we’ve got a big enough field to search. Still, I’m
confident I’m on the right track, and I shall jolly well
remain confident, however much you try to damp me.
So the next thing I’m going to do is to carry on with my
enquiries about a strange man being seen round these
cliffs between three and four-thirty last Tuesday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t do any harm, can it?” observed the
inspector restraining his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Me, sir?” said the inspector innocently.</p>

<p>“Yes, come on, Inspector; out with it. You know
perfectly well you’ve got your job of work all planned
out. Be a pal.”</p>

<p>The inspector smiled. “Well, if you must know, sir,
I’m going to make a few enquiries about this shoe.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Roger observed maliciously. “Well, it can’t
do any harm, can it?”</p>

<p>They laughed.</p>

<p>“Inspector,” said Roger softly, “can’t you forget for
once that you’re a member of an official body and be
human? I found that shoe for you. Isn’t it up to you to
let me know what the result of the few enquiries is? Not
for publication, of course, unless you say the word.”</p>

<p>The inspector struggled for a moment with his official
reticence. “Very well, Mr. Sheringham,” he said. “That’s
fair enough.”</p>

<p>“Sportsman!” Roger approved as they parted.</p>

<p>Before they had progressed fifty yards in opposite
directions, Roger had turned and was running back
again. “Inspector!” he called. “Half a minute!”</p>

<p>The inspector turned and waited for him, “Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I’ve always been meaning to ask
a real live police inspector,” Roger panted, “and
always forgetting at the crucial moment. What do
you <em>really</em> think at Scotland Yard of detective stories?”</p>

<p>The inspector ruminated. “Well, sir,” he said darkly,
“we must have our amusements, I suppose, like
everyone else.”</p>

<p>This time they really did part.</p>

<p>The inspector did not return to the inn for lunch, and
Roger and Anthony ate a somewhat silent meal, each
having plenty to occupy his own thoughts. Roger debated
for a short time whether to depute some of the enquiry
work, which now seemed to be assuming gigantic
proportions, to his cousin, but decided on consideration that
rather more delicate handling was required than
Anthony would probably be able to bring to it. That young
man therefore found himself with the afternoon off duty
once more, whereupon he announced casually that he
might not be back for tea and made a few guarded
enquiries as to the possibility of hiring a two-seater in
Ludmouth, just in case one happened to want to see
something of the country round. By a superhuman
effort Roger managed to refrain from all attempts to
amuse himself.</p>

<p>Immediately after lunch he set out once more on his
wearisome round.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o’clock before he returned, and
then it was with the glad face and bounding step of one
to whom success has come, doubly sweet because
almost hopelessly deferred. Anthony and the inspector,
half-way through their supper, looked round in
astonishment as the remaining member of their trio,
almost unrecognisable beneath the enormous grin which
decorated his countenance, burst in upon them like a
dervish.</p>

<p>“I’ve done it!” shouted the dervish. “Alone, unaided,
unhonoured and unsung, frowned upon by the official
police and snubbed by half the small boys in Ludmouth,
have I done it!” He produced a small piece of paper
from his pocket-book and laid it with a flourish beside
the inspector’s plate.</p>

<p>“There’s a present for you, Inspector Moresby,” he
said. “The thumb-print of Mrs. Vane’s murderer.
Anthony, carve me a double portion of that veal-and-ham
pie, please!”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br> Shocking Ignorance of a Clergyman</h2>

<p>“Of course,” said Roger, disposing of a large
mouthful of veal-and-ham pie, “of course when I
say <em>murderer</em>, I may be exaggerating a trifle.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me yet who he is, sir,” said the
inspector patiently. It was the seventh time he had said
something like this, and his curiosity was still
ungratified.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be safer to say, for the present,
that it’s the thumb-print of a man who knows how Mrs.
Vane met her death,” went on Roger, who was taking a
malicious joy in deliberately thwarting his professional
rival’s inquisitiveness. “Anyhow, there it is.”</p>

<p>“Did you say it was a man in the village?” asked the
inspector innocently.</p>

<p>“He that searches diligently shall find,” Roger
replied irrelevantly, “and he that is on the right tack
shall make all the thrilling discoveries. Likewise, to
him that hath shall be given; so give me some more of
this excellent pie, Anthony.—No, a slice just about twice
as big as the one you’re meditating.”</p>

<p>“Who <em>is</em> this man, Mr. Sheringham, sir?” demanded
the inspector in desperation.</p>

<p>Roger gazed at him blandly. “Inspector, I’m not
going to tell you! You may arrest me for obstructing the
police in the dereliction of their duty, for arson, fraud,
petty treason, or anything you darned well like, but
I’m not going to tell you. You insinuated yourself, as I
now realise, into my confidence this morning and very
neatly picked my brains, without giving anything in
return. All along I’ve been making you free presents of
my discoveries, and got practically nothing in exchange
for them. This time I’m hanging on.”</p>

<p>The inspector refilled his tankard and applied
himself to it with gusto. He set it down and wiped his
moustache. “Serious business, sir,” he observed,
apparently unmoved.</p>

<p>“Obstructing the police?” Roger agreed heartily.
“Yes, jolly serious, isn’t it? But awfully interesting. I’ve
never obstructed one before. I rather like it.”</p>

<p>The inspector laughed. “You’ve got something up
your sleeve, sir, I know. What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Send that thumb-print up to headquarters and see
if they can tell you anything about its owner,” Roger
said promptly. “Seriously, there may be nothing in this
at all, but there may be rather a lot. I’ve got my own
ideas, but I want to verify them before I tell you
anything definite. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not saying it isn’t highly irregular, sir;
it is. By rights you ought to tell me just what you’ve
discovered and let me be the judge of whether it’s worth
following up or not. Still, knowing you,” the inspector
concluded handsomely, “I’ll take the risk.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Roger approved. “And I promise to
tell you the whole story as soon as you’ve got the report,
even if it’s a negative one. By the way, if you jump to
it you’ve just got time to get it into the post to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” conceded the inspector, casting a
reluctant eye on his tankard. He rose to his feet. “You
won’t be gone when I come back?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall be here, even though I can’t say the
same for my cousin. That little two-seater I saw outside
wouldn’t have anything to do with you, Anthony, of
course?”</p>

<p>Anthony coloured slightly. “Well,” he began,
“I⸺”</p>

<p>“Enough!” Roger interrupted kindly. “You haven’t
taken it back yet, therefore you’re proposing to use it
again. Well, the country looks very charming by
moonlight, I’m told. <i lang="fr">Bon voyage!</i>— Oh, Inspector!”</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby paused, his hand on the
door-knob. “Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Did you find anything out about that shoe, by the
way?”</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby continued to pause. “Do you
expect me to tell you that, Mr. Sheringham, when you’re
withholding your own information?”</p>

<p>“A promise,” said Roger smugly, “is a promise,
Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Well, and I can’t say it wasn’t made in return for
services rendered. Very well, sir, I’ll return good for
evil. I traced that pair of shoes (we found the other one
all right, I should say).”</p>

<p>“Traced it, did you?” said Roger with interest. “Do
you mean, found out whom it belonged to?”</p>

<p>“Just that. The inner soles, with the name of the
maker, had been torn out, but it wasn’t a difficult job.
The servant-girl recognised ’em at once, and the mistress
admitted to ’em without hesitation.”</p>

<p>“Stop this cat-and-mouse act!” Roger implored.
“Whose were they?”</p>

<p>The inspector gazed at him stolidly for a moment,
enjoying his impatience. “Mrs. Russell’s, sir,” he said,
and withdrew.</p>

<p>As the door closed Roger emitted a long whistle of
astonishment. “Mrs. Russell’s! Good Lord, that’s an
unexpected development. How on earth—? What do you
make of that, Anthony?”</p>

<p>“Goodness knows,” said Anthony frankly.</p>

<p>Roger mused, helping himself abstractedly to
gooseberry-pie and cream. “Well, I suppose it’ll fit in all
right. I shall have to think that over.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to keep me in the dark too about the
bird with the thumb-print?” Anthony asked.</p>

<p>“You?” Roger recalled himself from his meditations.
“Oh, no. I’ve got to tell somebody or bust. Anthony,
I’ve had a heartrending day. Man, woman and child,
I’ve been cross-questioning them all till my throat,
hardened as you might think it, nearly collapsed under the
strain; and not a helpful word could I elicit. And then
at the very last gasp, quite literally, a little child led me
toward the light. I found an urchin who’d actually
been on the spot and seen just what I wanted him to have
seen.”</p>

<p>“Good egg!” quoth Anthony.</p>

<p>“I had a job to charm his information out of him, as
his business on the cliffs (I never did discover what it
was) seems to have been of an illicit nature; however,
fearful oaths of secrecy and a couple of half-crowns did
the trick. He was close to the top of the nearer flight
of steps at half-past three that afternoon, apparently
in hiding, and saw a man go down them and walk along
the ledge. He is even prepared to swear, Anthony, that
the man had a paper in his hand which didn’t seem to
be folded quite like a newspaper and might well have
been a copy of <i>London Opinion</i>.”</p>

<p>“Coo!” said Anthony. “And were you able to make
out who the cove was?”</p>

<p>“There was no need to do that. The urchin very kindly
supplied that information himself. Anthony, my lad,
who do you think it was? Just about the very last person
you’d expect.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>Roger regarded his companion with triumphant eyes.
“That blighted little parson, with a face like a
goat—the Rev. Samuel Blinking Meadows!”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a bit of a facer, isn’t it? So off I made in
a bee-line for Samuel. He’d pressed me to drop in
whenever I got the chance, so there was no difficulty about
that. I dropped. He was delighted to see me—oh,
delighted! And I was delighted to see him. We were both
delighted. We almost wept on one another’s necks with
delight. It was a touching scene. He wanted to discuss
the murder, but I didn’t. I wanted to discuss something
quite different. Theology, Anthony.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Quite so. I discussed theology. He didn’t. He didn’t
even know the name of Moses’s father-in-law, Anthony.
Shocking ignorance for a clergyman, wasn’t it? Of
course I didn’t let him see how shockingly ignorant I
thought him. I was a model of tact. I told him that Omar
Khayyám was my favourite among the minor prophets,
and he never turned a hair. I remarked that if Queen
Elizabeth hadn’t written the Athanasian Creed, Cardinal
Manning would never have condemned Joan of Arc to a
diet of worms, and he batted no eyelash. Oh, we <em>did</em>
enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“What you’re getting at, I suppose,” observed
Anthony acutely, “is that the chap isn’t a parson at all.”</p>

<p>“Anthony, you read my thoughts. No, the chap isn’t
a parson at all.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“So all I had to do then was to get his finger-print in
the orthodox manner, and come swiftly away. So that’s
that.”</p>

<p>“How did you manage the finger-print?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was simple enough. He was reading a
newspaper when I was shown in. I professed to find
something extremely interesting on the page he had been
perusing, and he readily gave me permission to tear it
off and take it away. To hold a newspaper it is of course
necessary to grip the edge quite firmly. For a
clergyman, Mr. Meadows evidently doesn’t wash his hands
as often as he might. It has also been a hot day. Nicely
planted in the margin was the perfect impression of a
somewhat greasy thumb. Thank you, Mr. Meadows.”</p>

<p>“Very cunning,” Anthony approved.</p>

<p>“I rather thought that, too,” Roger admitted.</p>

<p>“And you’re not going to say anything about it to the
inspector?”</p>

<p>“For the time being, no. I like having Moresby on
toast for a change, I must say, but also I don’t want to
commit myself. If anybody’s going to solve this pretty
little mystery, I want it to be Roger Sheringham; so
I’m not giving any information away unnecessarily. Of
course it <em>may</em> turn out that this chap had nothing to do
with it, but candidly, I don’t see how that can possibly
be the case.”</p>

<p>“And you think they’ll know about him at Scotland
Yard?”</p>

<p>“It seems a reasonable inference. People don’t go
about masquerading as clergymen just as an interesting
concomitant of their summer holiday. He may never
have been in the hands of the police at all, but there’s
always the hope.”</p>

<p>“It’ll make a better case against him if he has.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and help us in other ways too. You see, what
I’m really hoping is that he’s a slice out of Mrs. Vane’s
past. If so, we ought to be able to clear up quite a lot
of things that are obscure at present. He might even—”
Roger paused. “Oh, there are all sorts of possibilities,”
he corrected himself.</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness Margaret seems to be outside
it at last,” said Anthony.</p>

<p>“Yes, and talking of Margaret, Anthony, I want you
to treat what I’ve told you as highly confidential. It’s
much better for her not to know about this for the time
being, at any rate till we hear from Scotland Yard. It
may only raise false hopes, and in any case I don’t want
it talked about. You can simply say that I’m still
pursuing my enquiries. Is it a bet?”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure,” Anthony began, “that Margaret can
be trusted not to⸺”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a case of that at all,” Roger interrupted
peremptorily. “It’s simply that this information is to be
looked on as my private property till I choose to make it
public. If I can’t rely on you to keep things to yourself
when I don’t want them to go any further, then I simply
shan’t be able to tell you anything. Now then, what
about it?”</p>

<p>“Of course if you make such a point of it,” said
Anthony, a little sulkily.</p>

<p>“I do!”</p>

<p>“All right, then.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled,” Roger said cheerfully. “Have
some more beer.”</p>

<p>Anthony rose. “No thanks. As a matter of fact
I—I’ve got to be getting along now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that girl getting sick of the sight of you,
Anthony?” Roger asked with frank curiosity. “The
only times you leave her alone seem to be at meals.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s all by herself,” Anthony replied
defiantly. “She never sees the other two, except at meals.
If I didn’t go along there, she’d be quite alone.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it ever occurred to you to wonder whether she
wouldn’t prefer that?”</p>

<p>“Funny ass,” said Anthony tolerantly. “Well,
cheerio! See you later, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Grrrrr. . . .” said Roger coarsely.</p>

<p>However, Roger did not spend an uninteresting
evening. For three whole hours he was able to enjoy the
unbounded felicity of listening to Inspector Moresby
trying by every means in his power, subtle and official, to
obtain the name of the man whose thumb-print was on its
way to London. In gently balking all these indefatigable
attempts, Roger managed to enjoy himself quite
considerably.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch18">

<h2>Chapter XVIII. <br> Preparations for an Arrest</h2>

<p>The next day was a Sunday, and Roger made it a
day of rest. He did not welcome inactivity, but pending
the arrival of Scotland Yard’s report on the
thumb-print he did not quite see what there was to do. During
the morning he lay on the little grassy ledge and
lazily discussed the case and life in general with
Margaret and Anthony; during the afternoon he lay there
alone, with a book, while Margaret and Anthony
discussed other aspects of life somewhere else by
themselves. The inspector appeared to be busy on some trail
of his own, and was not in evidence.</p>

<p>In the evening Roger and Anthony both went to
supper at Dr. Vane’s. It appeared that the doctor had taken
a liking to Roger, and the invitation had come from him.
He even went so far as to close the laboratory altogether
from six o’clock onward, which Roger rightly
interpreted as a compliment of the first magnitude. They
passed a pleasant if quiet evening, and no reference was
made by anybody to Mrs. Vane, her death or the
resulting investigations. “In fact,” as Roger confided later to
Anthony during their walk home, “if one hadn’t been
told it was a house of mourning, one would never have
guessed for an instant that the mistress of it died
violently less than a week ago.”</p>

<p>Roger found himself returning Dr. Vane’s liking
almost with interest. The big, burly man was so genuine,
so sincere, and (as Roger felt) so transparently
honest. His predilections he did not attempt to disguise, and
where he hated Roger was sure he would be no less
candid. Summing up his impressions on their rather silent
walk home, Roger found himself convinced that,
whatever his feelings may have been once, the doctor had
very little affection for his wife at the time of her death.
Equally certainly his attitude toward Miss Williamson
was one merely of rather impersonal camaraderie.</p>

<p>“A disheartening business for any modest girl who’s
trying as hard as that lady is, I should imagine,” Roger
told himself.</p>

<p>The next day was also a period of enforced rest. On
this occasion, however, Roger had not only himself but
Anthony as well to amuse. Margaret, it transpired,
burdened by the household duties of a Monday, was unable
to devote a single minute to anything outside them.
Roger, fancying that he was able to appreciate these
tactics, watched a restless Anthony moodily kicking
small stones on the road in front of the inn till eleven
o’clock, when the second post brought no official envelope
for Inspector Moresby, and then carried him off in the
hired two-seater to spend the day in Sandsea. They got
back at half-past seven (the two-seater, which was of a
decidedly decrepit nature, having behaved not at all
well by the roadside) and found the inspector awaiting
them in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Inspector,” Roger said at once. “Any news
by the last post?”</p>

<p>The inspector regarded him benevolently. “Yes, sir;
I’ve heard from headquarters.”</p>

<p>“Have you? Any luck?”</p>

<p>“Luck, sir?” said the inspector with maddening
deliberation. “Well, it depends what you call luck, doesn’t
it? Are you two gentlemen ready for supper? I’m so
hungry, I could eat an ox. Funny thing, the heat always
seems to make me hungry. My wife says⸺”</p>

<p>“Inspector,” Roger interrupted rudely, “I’m sorry
for your wife and family. Very sorry. They must suffer
a good deal. By the way, did you say you <em>had</em> heard
from Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I have. Why?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to play mouse to your cat, Inspector
Moresby,” Roger said with dignity. “So hand over that
report, before I break your head. Even a mouse will
turn, you know.”</p>

<p>“I thought we could talk about it after supper, Mr.
Sheringham,” the inspector remarked innocently.</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, think again. Report, please
Inspector!”</p>

<p>“He’s an impatient sort of gentleman, your cousin,
isn’t he?” the inspector observed to Anthony, grinning
maddeningly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s awfully dangerous when roused. We
always humour him in the family.”</p>

<p>“Is that good for him though, in the long run?” asked
the inspector with an air of earnest enquiry. “Now my
experience of these impatient people is that you ought
to⸺”</p>

<p>Roger opened the door and called downstairs.
“Landlord, empty the flowing bowl! We shan’t want our
supper till midnight!”</p>

<p>“I give in, sir,” said the inspector hastily. “Here’s
the report!”</p>

<p>“Fill the flowing bowl, landlord,” Roger
countermanded in stentorian tones. “We’ll have supper at
once.”</p>

<p>The report was all that Roger could have desired. Its
laconic wording ran as follows:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The impression is of the right thumb of Sam Field, <i lang="la">alias</i>
Slippery Sam, <i lang="la">alias</i> The Shrimp, <i lang="la">alias</i> The
Sky Pilot, <i lang="la">alias</i> Herbert Peters, <i lang="la">alias</i>
Herbert Smith, etc. etc. Served two years,
1909–11, for robbery with violence; three years, 1913–16, for
burglary; five years, 1918–23, for fraud and embezzlement.
Wanted now on three similar charges. Small, dark, mole on
right cheek, blue eyes, large nose; good education, speaks
well, ingratiating manners. Fond of disguising himself as a
solicitor, clergyman or other member of the professional
classes.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“Golly!” observed Roger, and handed the report to
Anthony.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d be interested, sir,” said the
inspector blandly. “So it’s the Rev. Samuel Meadows, is it?
I thought I’d seen that man’s face before, if you
remember. Must have had a photograph of him through
my hands.”</p>

<p>“Herbert Peters!” Roger murmured raptly. “Do you
know, I <em>guessed</em> right inside me that he’d turn out to
be Mrs. Vane’s husband, but I daren’t put it into words;
it seemed too good to be true. But I thought you said
you’d got no information about Herbert Peters?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was a bad bit of routine work,” the
inspector admitted handsomely.</p>

<p>“You’ve got no doubts about it now, I suppose?”
Roger persisted.</p>

<p>The inspector did not reply directly. “What do you
imagine his motive was?” he asked instead.</p>

<p>“Well, he was blackmailing her, obviously. It was a
gift for him. She married the doctor when he was in the
middle of that five years’ stretch, evidently hoping that
he wouldn’t be able to trace her. Oh, yes; it was a gift for
friend Peters.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t answer my question, sir,” the
inspector pointed out mildly. “That would be a motive for
her murdering him, not he her. What do you imagine <em>his</em>
motive was?”</p>

<p>Roger helped himself to pickled onions. “Well, it’s
impossible to say definitely, isn’t it? I daresay I could
think of half-a-dozen perfectly good motives, but this
one strikes me as the most obvious: she knew there were
two or three warrants out against him, so she countered
his threat of blackmail with a threat of her own, to hand
him over to the police. He got the wind up and pushed
her over the cliff in a sudden panic. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“That’s quite plausible,” the inspector agreed.</p>

<p>“After you with the potatoes, Anthony,” said Roger.
“Well, what do you think about it, fair coz?”</p>

<p>“Seems clear enough to me. We know he was there,
and as you say, he probably had plenty of motives.
Perhaps he was really in love with her and frightfully
jealous. Then he might have sort of seen red when she told
him what she’d done, mightn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a good idea,” Roger agreed. “No
blackmail at all, you mean. And that fits in with what
Margaret said about her being frightened of somebody a
week or two before her death. By the way, Anthony,
you can tell Margaret now that she needn’t bother about
searching any more in Mrs. Vane’s papers.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir?” queried the inspector.</p>

<p>Roger explained how he had been trying to approach
the identity of the mysterious stranger by two different
routes.</p>

<p>“Going behind the backs of the official police, eh?”
the inspector commented. “Well, well, reporters will be
reporters, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“And officials will be official. Well, what are you
going to do about it all, official one? You’ll arrest him,
of course?”</p>

<p>“Am I talking to a reporter?” asked the inspector
cautiously.</p>

<p>“Not unless you want to. ‘Important developments
are expected at any minute.’ Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p>“For the time being, if you please, sir. I shan’t arrest
him to-night, you see.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll go along and see a magistrate and get a
warrant after supper, but I shan’t arrest him till to-morrow
morning. There’s no hurry, and it’s more convenient in a
little place like this. He can’t have taken alarm at your
interview with him on Saturday, or he’d have cleared out
before now, and I’ve already made sure he hasn’t done
that.”</p>

<p>“But why trouble to traipse off to a magistrate and
get a warrant?” Roger asked curiously. “I thought you
didn’t need a warrant for an arrest on suspicion of
murder.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to arrest him on suspicion of
murder, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re not?” Roger said in surprise. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“For several reasons,” the inspector returned
non-committally. “For one thing it’s handier, when there are
other reasons for arresting a man, not to do so on the
murder charge. They’re more liable to give themselves
away than if you’ve started off by frightening them to
death already. We usually find it pays. And besides, it
gives us an excuse for holding them when our murder
evidence may not be quite complete.”</p>

<p>“I see. I’m learning things about our official
criminologists.”</p>

<p>“We’re nasty people to get into the hands of, sir,”
the inspector said jovially.</p>

<p>“You are indeed. I shall think quite seriously before
committing my next murder. And you imagine you’ll
be able to induce Meadows to give himself away?”</p>

<p>“We have our ways of making people talk,” observed
the inspector darkly.</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be getting along now,” said Anthony,
and went.</p>

<p>Roger regarded the closed door for a moment. “It’s
nice to be young,” he said, from the depths of his
thirty-six years.</p>

<p>“Humph, yes; but there’s a rude awakening
coming, I’m afraid,” replied the inspector with surprising
gloom.</p>

<p>“Your profession seems to have made a pessimist of
you, Inspector,” Roger smiled.</p>

<p>The inspector meditated this. “Well, perhaps it has;
but there’s one thing I have learnt—things are seldom
in reality as they appear on the surface! And that’s a
thing youth never has and never will learn.”</p>

<p>“Hark to the disillusionment of middle-age!” Roger
laughed, refusing to echo the other’s suddenly serious
tone.</p>

<p>They settled down to a comfortable discussion of the
case.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing that still puzzles me,” Roger
said a little later. “Everything else falls into place
neatly enough, but what on earth is a pair of Mrs.
Russell’s shoes doing in the jig-saw?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering when you’d come to them,” the
inspector agreed.</p>

<p>“There <em>are</em> ways in which the chap could get hold
of them, of course,” Roger mused. “I did myself. Or
I suppose he could have bought them at a jumble sale,
or picked them out of the ash-bin. But why? And why
Mrs. Russell’s?”</p>

<p>“There are all sorts of ways of accounting for that
pair of shoes, I take it,” the inspector said thoughtfully.
“Your idea is that his object was to leave a female trail
behind him, if he was going to leave any trail at all?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the same as with the coat-button. Substituting
the Rev. Samuel’s name for Miss Williamson’s, by the
way, I think the explanation you put forward to account
for the coat-button must be the correct one, Inspector.
It certainly seems the simplest.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, if all he wanted was to leave a
female trail,” continued the inspector, who evidently
preferred to deal with one point at a time, “the
question of the ownership of the shoes becomes unimportant.
All that matters is that they shall be female shoes, and
large enough for him to be able to get into them more
or less, after their sides have been split. Isn’t that what
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the inspector, with an air of clinching
the topic, “as I said, then, there are all sorts of ways of
accounting for his possession of that pair.”</p>

<p>“That’s perfectly true,” Roger assented.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the inspector left to seek his
magistrate.</p>

<p>He had not been gone long before Anthony returned.
Margaret had seemed a little seedy (reported the
latter), admitting on pressure to a touch of hay fever or
incipient influenza or something equally depressing, and
had been unable to stop out long, nor had Anthony
pressed her to allow him to accompany her indoors for
a time; with reluctance both had agreed that she would
be better in bed. However, he had been able to break
the great news to her and was now the bearer of her
heartiest and rapturous congratulations to Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sorry you’re back, Anthony, I must
say,” observed that gentleman, having elicited these
facts. “Entrancing though my company should be, I was
beginning to get just a trifle satiated with it. Besides, it’s
a shame and an abominable thing to stay indoors on an
evening like this. Let’s stroll down to the sea-level and
gloat over the moonlight on a rock somewhere, while
your Uncle Roger tells you what a great man he is.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Before letting him out of his sight, Roger had
extracted a promise from the unwilling inspector, obtained
by means of the most blatant threats in connection with
his capacity as a reporter, to allow him to be in at the
death on the following morning. Not altogether trusting
to the efficacy of a promise won under such conditions
however, he was out of bed at least an hour earlier than
usual and proceeded to watch the inspector’s door with
lynx-eyed assiduity. He need not really have troubled.
Inspector Moresby, while quite alive to the advantages
of appearing to grant a difficult favour, had not the
least objection to figuring on a million breakfast-tables
as the hero of a thrilling arrest, complete with full
details “from our special correspondent, who was an
actual eye-witness of the scene.” Not the very least
objection. Roger had lost an hour’s sleep for nothing.</p>

<p>They breakfasted and set out together, leaving
Anthony to kick his heels in the inn or meditate over the
beauties of nature from the top of a convenient cliff as
he saw fit.</p>

<p>The house in which the Rev. Samuel Meadows, <i lang="la">alias</i> Slippery
Sam, <i lang="la">alias</i> Herbert Peters, <i lang="la">alias</i> etc. etc.,
had taken rooms, was in the centre of the village. The two
walked briskly along to the front door, Roger on his toes
with excitement at reaching the end of the chase, the
inspector relating anecdotes of the <em>really</em> interesting
arrests he had effected.</p>

<p>A stout woman opened the door to them and smiled
as she recognised Roger. “Yes, he’s in his sitting-room,”
she said, in answer to their inquiries. “I took his
breakfast along not much over an hour ago, and he hasn’t
gone out yet. Not but what he isn’t a quiet gentleman
altogether, the Rev. Meadows; never does go out much,
he doesn’t. Keeps ’imself <em>to</em> ’imself, as you might say.
A better lodger I couldn’t wish for. Now the last
gentleman who had these rooms⸺”</p>

<p>“Can we go along?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“To be sure you can, sir,” agreed the stout woman
with much heartiness. “You know the way, don’t you?
Seeing as you were here only the other day, I mean.
And you might tell him I’ll be down in a minute for the
tray, will you, sir? Then you’ll be more comfortable-like,
you see. I ought to have fetched it sooner, I know,
but what with one thing and another, there! the time
goes before you ever notice it’s gone, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Long before,” Roger murmured mechanically,
following the inspector down the narrow passage. Still
discoursing, the stout woman disappeared into the upper
regions.</p>

<p>The two stopped out of sight of the stairs and Roger
indicated the door of the Rev. Samuel’s sitting-room.
Dispensing with the formality of a knock, the inspector
pushed it open and entered.</p>

<p>Just inside the threshold he halted so abruptly that
Roger, following close on his heels, collided with his
burly back. “Hullo!” he exclaimed softly. “Hul-<em>lo!</em>”</p>

<p>Roger peered over his shoulder. The Rev. Samuel
Meadows was certainly there, for he could see him
seated in a chair by the window, a copy of the <i>Courier</i>
across his knees. But his head was sunk on his chest, one
arm hung limply by his side, and his whole attitude was
twisted and unnatural.</p>

<p>“Good God!” Roger exclaimed in shocked tones.
“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>The inspector strode forward, bent to peer into the
half-hidden face, and thrust his hand inside the
clerical coat. Then he stood up and tugged at his moustache,
staring down at the still, crumpled figure.</p>

<p>“The matter, sir?” he repeated slowly. “He’s dead—that’s
what’s the matter with him.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch19">

<h2>Chapter XIX. <br> End of a Scoundrel</h2>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Then:</p>

<p>“<em>Dead?</em>” Roger echoed incredulously. “You say
he’s <em>dead?</em>”</p>

<p>“As a door-nail,” asserted the inspector without
emotion. “Only just (he’s still warm), but dead right
enough.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned!” said Roger blankly.</p>

<p>The inspector turned his eyes back to the motionless
form in the chair and continued to tug his moustache.
“Hell!” he observed simply. As an epitaph for the Rev.
Samuel the remark was perhaps not inapposite.</p>

<p>“This appears to have torn it,” Roger said, closing
the door behind him and advancing gingerly.</p>

<p>“It does indeed,” the inspector agreed, and his tone
was one of profound regret. Roger gathered that the
inspector was feeling balked.</p>

<p>Together they gazed at the occupant of the chair.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the next move?” Roger asked, after a
full minute’s silence.</p>

<p>The inspector seemed to recall himself with an effort
from some meditation of his own. “The next move?”
he repeated vaguely. “Well, we shall have to get a
doctor in at once, of course. And as you’re here, sir,” he
went on in brisker tones, “I wish you’d be good enough
to get him for me, will you? By rights I ought to stay
here and see that nothing’s disturbed and the body left
untouched; and I shall want a word with the landlady
too.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” Roger assented at once. “Any
particular doctor?”</p>

<p>“Well, there probably won’t be more than one in a
place this size. The landlady can tell us his name and
address. It’s early yet, so you ought to be able to catch
him before he goes out. And on your way back you
might see if you can get hold of the local constable (he
lives quite near here, I know) and send him along too.
I don’t want to let the body out of my sight for more
than a second at a time till he comes, and that’ll leave
me a bit freer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather,” Roger said, opening the door, “I’ll go
at once.”</p>

<p>They made their way out into the passage and the
inspector sent a stentorian voice flying upstairs in search
of the landlady. She appeared at the top of the stairs,
wiping her hands on a floor-cloth.</p>

<p>“Mr. Meadows is ill,” said the inspector abruptly.
“What’s the name and address of the nearest doctor?”</p>

<p>“Ill, is he?” said the stout landlady, much concerned.
“Well, that’s funny. Poor gentleman! He seemed quite
all right when I took his breakfast in to him. Not
serious, I do hope? ‘Good-morning, Mrs. Harper,’ he said,
just the same as usual. ‘What’ve you got for breakfast
to-day?’ he said. And I⸺”</p>

<p>Firmly the inspector cut short the flow of the
volubility and extracted the desired information. Roger set
out, leaving him to break the news to her of her lodger’s
untimely death. It was strange, he reflected, that
although in the past few people could have ardently
desired for the Rev. Samuel, under any of his
pseudonyms, a long lease of life, yet his death was a matter
of deep regret for everybody in Ludmouth who had had
anything to do with him.</p>

<p>The doctor’s house was over half-a-mile distant, and
with the help of an intermittent jog-trot Roger managed
to cover the ground to it in less than five minutes. As
the inspector had predicted, the doctor had not yet
started out on his rounds and, his surgery being just
over, Roger was able to see him at once. Somewhat
breathlessly he stated his business, the doctor, a tall,
angular man with pince-nez on a pointed nose, asked
a few pertinent questions and hastily stuffed some
things into a small leather bag, and they set off together
on foot, Dr. Young apologising briefly for not being able
to offer a seat in his car, which was not yet ready for its
morning’s work.</p>

<p>They walked briskly, in spite of the growing heat of
the day, but not too briskly for Roger to volunteer the
answers to various questions which the doctor might
have asked but didn’t.</p>

<p>Fortunately their route took them past the house of
the local constable, which Dr. Young was able to
point out, and the latter waited while Roger routed out
its occupant and told him to get into tunic and helmet
and follow on as quickly as he could. The constable’s
large red jaw dropped ludicrously as he assimilated
Roger’s terse communication.</p>

<p>Let into the house by the now white-faced and
speechless landlady, they hurried down the passage and into
the sitting-room. With a nod to the inspector the doctor
stood for a moment, allowing his trained eye to take in
and photograph on his brain every detail of the dead
man’s attitude. Then he approached to make a closer and
more detailed examination, scrutinising the surface of
the skin and tilting back the head to obtain a clear view
of the face.</p>

<p>“No distortion,” he murmured, half to himself and
half to the inspector. “No convulsions before death.” He
lifted an eyelid with his thumb and peered into the eye.
“Pupils not contracted,” he announced, and went
on with methodical care to examine the dead man’s
tongue.</p>

<p>Roger watched the rather gruesome business with
profound interest. He had already formed a tentative theory
to account for the man’s death, and was anxiously
awaiting some confirmation of it from the doctor’s lips. In
the passage outside the constable signalled his arrival
by blowing his nose importantly.</p>

<p>The doctor straightened up and adjusted his pince-nez,
turning to the inspector. “You’ve got the case in
hand?” he remarked. “Inspector Moresby, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir,” said the inspector, economically
answering both questions at once.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard about you, of course. Gossip soon
travels in a place like this, and the doctor’s always one
of the first to hear it. Well, it seems you’re going to have
a second case to look after, Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the inspector.</p>

<p>The doctor indicated the body with a careless gesture.
“Know anything about him?”</p>

<p>“Very little,” the Inspector replied untruthfully. “I’d
got my eye on him, though,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“Any reason to suspect suicide?” asked the doctor
curtly.</p>

<p>“Well—no reason to <em>ex</em>pect it, doctor,” returned the
inspector with some care. “No, certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Um!” The doctor removed his pince-nez and began
to polish them with his handkerchief. “You were on your
way to arrest him, I understand?”</p>

<p>“Somebody seems to have been talking,” the inspector
observed, and grinned openly at Roger’s guilty blush.</p>

<p>“I mean,” amplified the doctor, “there may be some
connection.”</p>

<p>“You think it’s poison, then?” enquired the inspector
genially.</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. “I can’t possibly say that yet, till
I’ve examined the body. At present I see no marks of
violence. I’d like to get him on to his bed; will you give
me a hand?”</p>

<p>Between them they carried the slight figure without
difficulty upstairs and into a room which the stout
landlady, fluttering round them like a corpulent hen on the
landing, indicated as the dead man’s bedroom. The
doctor began to undress the body, the inspector helping him,
and Roger, for once feeling himself in the way, retired
to the sitting-room downstairs to await their verdict.</p>

<p>On the floor by the chair in which the dead man had
been sitting lay his pipe, fallen no doubt from his
nerveless hand. Roger was about to pick it up with aimless
curiosity, when he remembered that nothing should be
handled except by the official police. He sat down on a
hard horsehair sofa of uninviting aspect and began to
think furiously.</p>

<p>At the first shock this unexpected death had seemed
completely to upset his carefully worked out theory, the
success of which had seemed last night to be a foregone
conclusion; but during his hurried mission to the doctor
even this had fallen into its place in the scheme. Long
before the word suicide had been mentioned at all Roger
had arrived at the same conclusion. This explanation,
he had realised, so far from upsetting the theory,
comfortably confirmed it. Meadows must have got wind of
the fact that the net was being drawn round him, and
had taken in desperation the only way out. And how had
he thus got wind? Even though he was alone, Roger
wriggled a trifle guiltily.</p>

<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that Roger had
betrayed the inspector’s confidence. It would be no
exaggeration at all to say, putting it on its mildest
possible terms, that he had been indiscreet. Actually in
touch over the telephone with the editor of the <i>Courier</i>
(that great man) himself, he had let slip something
more than the demure “important developments are
expected at any minute” of his official report; he had, in
fact, so far given way to his temperamental volubility
as to hint that the important developments were due
entirely to the <i>Courier’s</i> own special correspondent and
his remarkable acumen, the said correspondent having
unearthed in the neighbourhood, by a cunning and
perspicacity far exceeding that of his official colleague and
rival, the presence of a notorious criminal whose past
life had been discovered to be bound up with that of the
deceased, who had ample motive for compassing her
death, and who was actually going to be arrested, though
not ostensibly on this account, the very next day—all
of which had duly appeared, in a little laudatory article
upon the special correspondent, as a preface to his own
article that morning. It is true that Roger had imagined
himself to be speaking in the strictest confidence, but he
had certainly erred in overestimating a newsman’s sense
of personal honour where his paper’s interests are
concerned.</p>

<p>He glanced across at the <i>Courier</i> which had been
taken from the dead man’s knees and wriggled again.
Reading that little paragraph, Meadows could hardly
fail to realise that his game was up; nobody else
perhaps could see the personal application, but to the man
concerned it must have been as clear as daylight. Roger
ruefully anticipated a bad quarter-of-an-hour with the
inspector. However leniently the latter might be disposed
to treat the slip and however readily he might accept
Roger’s own explanation, this must mean the end of
even such meagre confidences as he had been cajoled
into bestowing.</p>

<p>Roger began to compose a letter to the editor of
the <i>Courier</i> in which he purposed to acquaint that great
man with the precise and unvarnished state of his
feelings toward him.</p>

<p>He was still in the middle of its vitriolic sentences
when the inspector and the doctor reappeared.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the former was saying, “I’ll arrange all that
with the Coroner, doctor. Ten o’clock to-morrow
morning, the inquest (I don’t see that we can put it much
earlier than that) so you’ll be able to get going by
eleven.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Simpson—the Coroner—I’m afraid you’ll find
him rather a fussy little man,” said the doctor
doubtfully. “Very full of his own dignity and importance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t tread on his toes,” the inspector laughed.
“I’m used to fussy coroners, I can tell you. I promise
you he’ll call the inquest for ten all right, when I’ve
done with him. And you’ll get in touch with the Sandsea
man right away?”</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. “Yes, but of course the Coroner
will have to confirm it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see he does that,” returned the inspector
confidently. “Dear me, look like having a busy day in front
of me, don’t I? And then there’s all these things in here
to seal up and send to Sir Henry Griffen for analysis.
Bother the Rev. Samuel Meadows! What did he want
to go and give me all this trouble for?”</p>

<p>“It is suicide, then?” eagerly put in Roger, who had
been waiting with impatience during this exchange for
an opportunity of learning what had been discovered.
“He did take poison?”</p>

<p>Dr. Young looked disapproving before this leading
question. “Really, it’s quite impossible to say yet; we
must look to the post-mortem to establish the cause of
death. There are no signs of apoplexy, it’s true, but he
may have had a bad heart. It’s impossible to say
anything definitely yet.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait for the adjourned inquest for all
that, Mr. Sheringham, sir,” said the inspector
reprovingly, though his eyes twinkled. “Be careful what you
say to this gentleman,” he added to the doctor. “He’s a
pressman. They’re all unscrupulous, but he’s worse than
most.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Roger, considerably relieved to find that
the other was disposed to treat his blunder so jocularly.
“Yes, I’ve got to grovel to you, Inspector, I know. I’ve
got a perfectly good explanation, but I know I don’t
deserve to be forgiven. Say when you’ve got a spare
quarter-of-an-hour to-day, and I’ll come and grovel <i lang="la">ad
lib</i>.” He turned to the doctor. “Then those are the only
three possibilities—apoplexy, heart or poison?”</p>

<p>“So far as one can say,” agreed the doctor guardedly.</p>

<p>“And you’ve no idea at all what poison it is?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea that it is even poison at all.”</p>

<p>Roger eyed his interlocutor sadly. There was such a
lot of possible information to be obtained, and
apparently so little probability of obtaining it. For the life
of him he did not know what to ask next.</p>

<p>“Well, doctor, you’ll be wanting to get along now, I
suppose,” the inspector broke in on this dilemma. “And
Mr. Sheringham, I’m afraid I shall have to turn you
out of here. This room’s got to be kept locked from now
on, and nobody allowed in except under orders from
me.”</p>

<p>“Right-ho, Inspector,” Roger acquiesced. “And of
course all these breakfast things and so on will have to
be analysed, if they do find poison in the body, won’t
they? By the way, there’s his pipe on the floor there; he
may have been smoking it just before he died.—Well,
doctor, if we’re to be turned out, I’ll stroll along part of
the way with you.”</p>

<p>The doctor managed to conceal his joy at the
prospect.</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby watched them go with his twinkle
in full action. His obvious surmise was not amiss. Roger
obtained some excellent exercise, but nothing else. For
half-a-mile he walked by the doctor’s side, pumping
busily; but either the well of his companion’s
information had run dry or else the pumping machinery was out
of gear. In either case, truth remained coyly in her
fastness and none of Roger’s strenuous efforts succeeded in
bringing her to the surface.</p>

<p>Returning disconsolate to the inn, however, he had a
pleasant surprise in finding Anthony unexpectedly in
attendance. For the next hour or two he was able to
discourse, on the farthest unsubmerged rock, to a thrilled
audience of one to his heart’s content.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch20">

<h2>Chapter XX. <br> Poisons and Pipes</h2>

<p>Roger did not see the inspector again that day
till supper, when he was obviously tired out and
disinclined to talk. He referred in terms of gentle sarcasm
to Roger’s breach of trust, though quite without heat, his
attitude being one rather of disillusionment than anger;
one gathered that the person he really blamed for the
business was himself, for being such a consummate
idiot as to trust a journalist. He listened to Roger’s
explanation and apologies and accepted the latter, but
retaliated, as the culprit had foreseen, by refusing to utter
a single word about the case.</p>

<p>The inquest was duly opened the following morning,
but though Roger attended in a spirit of pious hope
nothing of the least importance transpired. Twelve
solemn rustics viewed the body and then sat perspiring
in the village schoolroom, and that was practically all
that happened. Almost the only witness was the stout
landlady, who was able to give evidence of identity
and who also had been the last person to see the
deceased alive. She agreed, in the time-hallowed formula,
that he had then seemed in his usual health and spirits,
and added, with more originality, that had he been there
when she heard of his death the Coroner could have
knocked her down with a feather. She was going on
to add a good deal more, but was held with a testy hand.</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby deposed to finding the body, and
Roger, somewhat to his surprise, was called to give
corroborative evidence. As to who the dead man really
was, the inspector preserved a strict silence; and
whether the Coroner had been taken into the secret
or not, the court was apparently content to accept the
Rev. Meadows as a chance visitor to Ludmouth on a
prolonged stay and made no inquiry into his
antecedents. The whole proceedings had not lasted more
than a quarter-of-an-hour when, Dr. Young being called
and stating his inability to give the cause of death,
the enquiry was adjourned for this to be ascertained
and the Coroner formally ordered a post-mortem to
be made.</p>

<p>Naturally the news of this second death increased the
public interest in the Ludmouth Mystery, as it was
now generally called, and in spite of Inspector
Moresby’s careful reticence popular imagination was
not slow to link the two tragedies together. Newspapers
which had hitherto paid little attention to the affair
made haste to send down their own representatives, and
Roger had cause half-a-dozen times a day to
congratulate himself on his foresight in preventing all other
intruders from finding foothold in the Crown. To all
enquirers the landlord, that mountainous man, presented
an ox-like front of stolid imperturbability: they couldn’t
have a room, for why? there wasn’t one, that was why.
Even offers of double or treble the market-price failed
to move him. He seemed to have conceived a bovine
affection for Roger (opposites, it has already been said,
do sometimes make for a male friendship), and
followed out his guest’s wishes to the letter, bewildered
but faithful. By way of some return Roger felt
compelled to drink as much beer as he could possibly
contain.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thereafter matters progressed for the next ten days
or so, inasmuch as the actual case was concerned, not
at all. Indeed so far as Roger could see the whole thing
was over, bar the shouting. The finding of poison of
some description in the body and the subsequent
verdict (after Inspector Moresby had unfolded the real
story) of suicide during temporary insanity, was
practically a foregone conclusion. Roger’s articles in
the <i>Courier</i> grew shorter and shorter as he found it
increasingly difficult to find anything new to say, and he
would have given them up altogether had the editor not
made it a personal favour that he should carry them
up to the adjourned inquest in order to help the paper
as much as possible over the slack season. And all the
time Inspector Moresby gave a really first-class
imitation of a sphinx, so far as any unusual happenings
in Ludmouth were concerned.</p>

<p>During these days Roger converted for the most part
what had been chiefly a duet during the proceeding
week, into a trio. The original members made no
audible protest, but whatever their real feelings on the
point Roger saw no reason why, having brought
Anthony for the express purpose of keeping him company,
he should be callously abandoned to loneliness just
because his susceptible cousin’s fancy in companionship
happened to have strayed temporarily elsewhere—or
so at any rate he phrased it to himself; for after all,
one could hardly expect Roger to admit, even privately,
to jealousy of a young man nearly a dozen years his
junior. At other times he told himself seriously that it
was no less than his duty to break up his
cousin’s <i lang="fr">tête-à-têtes</i> with a young woman of (when all was said
and done) distinctly doubtful origin and antecedents; it
might be an awkward thing, Roger pointed out earnestly
to himself, were Anthony to become in any way <em>involved;</em>
his mother would have a good deal to say
about it, and she would certainly say it, and forcibly,
to him. Roger continued to martyr himself to duty.</p>

<p>In the course of his devotion to this stern mistress,
he observed Margaret closely. Now that she had been
definitely cleared of the horrible suspicion of causing
her cousin’s death, her demeanour had altered
perceptibly. The iron self-control which she must have
been exerting during that week was relaxed, and signs
of a corresponding reaction were not infrequent. At
one moment she would be more self-reliant than she
had appeared before, and less dependent upon their
strength; at another she would laugh almost
hysterically and propose the maddest escapades on the spur
of the moment. Anthony she kept continually upon
tenterhooks of bewilderment, treating him one day as
if she were seriously in love with him and the next as
if he bored her beyond words.</p>

<p>Roger was convinced that there was really nothing
of the coquette in her, that she was as straightforward
and unguileful as he could wish a girl to be, so that
he found himself at times seriously perturbed about
her. The place, he felt sure, exercised a distressing
effect upon her, and he continued to urge her to leave
it, if only for a temporary holiday. Her manner of
receiving these suggestions was on a par with the rest
of her behaviour: one day she would say shortly that
it was quite impossible for the moment, that she must
stay and look after George till everything had quite
blown over; on another she would jump eagerly at the
idea and begin to discuss, quite seriously, the
feasibility of flying over to Paris and embarking on a hectic
European tour the very next day—yet when it came to
the point of a final decision it was always the first mood
which prevailed with her. In some vague way Roger felt
a certain responsibility for her, and it worried him more
than he would have cared to admit.</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby evidently also felt that the case
was only marking time during these days, pending
definite confirmation of the existence of poison in the
body from Sir Henry Griffen, the Home Office analyst,
for he took the opportunity of going over to Sandsea
for a couple of days to resume his interrupted holiday
with his wife and family. It seemed as if he was anxious
not to lose touch with Ludmouth, however, for he only
took two days when he might have taken five, and was
back again at the inn considerably before Roger
expected him.</p>

<p>As for Anthony, that young business man began to
feel seriously alarmed as the days went by that he would
have to return to London before the adjourned inquest
brought the case definitely to an end. He had only got
three weeks’ holiday, and already two of them were
gone. Careful though he had been to conceal any
exuberant display of admiration, Anthony really had
found himself profoundly impressed by Roger’s
handling of the case and his laying bare of its hidden core
which even such a tough bird as Inspector Moresby had
failed to uncover, and it would have broken his heart
to be compelled to leave before all the threads were
finally unravelled and the last knots smoothed out.</p>

<p>Fortunately he was not called upon to do so. The
Rev. Samuel had died on a Tuesday; on the following
Friday the inspector had gone over to Sandsea,
returning on Sunday evening; on the next Thursday,
exactly a fortnight after his arrival in Ludmouth, Roger
was sitting alone with the inspector after supper—and
for once Inspector Moresby was not feeling quite
so official as usual.</p>

<p>It happened like this:</p>

<p>“I wonder,” Roger had said, “when you’ll hear from
Sir Henry about the cause of death.”</p>

<p>And the inspector replied, surprisingly: “Oh, I heard
yesterday morning!” He may have felt tempted to bite
his tongue out immediately afterward, but indubitably
that is what Inspector Moresby replied.</p>

<p>“You did?” squeaked Roger. “Inspector, you—you
taciturn devil!”</p>

<p>The inspector applied himself to such small remnants
of beer as were still to be found at the bottom of his
tankard. “Perhaps it was about time for me to be a
little more taciturn than I have been sometimes,” he
remarked with ominous application from its depths.</p>

<p>“But I’ve grovelled about that,” Roger said eagerly.
“Simply grovelled. Also I’ve explained it all away.
Nothing like that will ever occur again.—Inspector,
you—you <em>are</em> going to tell me what Sir Henry said,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>The inspector, having arrived at the regretful
conclusion that his tankard really was empty this time,
replaced it on the table. “No, Mr. Sheringham, sir,” he
said with a good deal of firmness. “I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are!” Roger wailed. “Don’t you remember?
Think again. You—you are, really.”</p>

<p>“I’m really not,” retorted the inspector still more
firmly.</p>

<p>They eyed one another in silence.</p>

<p>“Have some more beer!” said Roger helpfully.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to bribe me, sir?” asked the
inspector sternly.</p>

<p>“Certainly I am,” Roger replied with dignity. “Do
you want everything put into blatant words?”</p>

<p>“Then thank you, sir,” said the inspector. “I could
do with another pint on a night like this.”</p>

<p>Roger went with alacrity to the door. “Not a quart?”
he suggested, “Come, it’s a hot night as you say. What
about a gallon? No? You’re no sportsman, I’m afraid.”
He shouted out the order to the landlord and returned
to his seat.</p>

<p>“Seriously, though, sir,” the inspector resumed, “I’m
afraid I can’t say anything about Sir Henry’s report.
You’ll have to wait for the inquest. It’ll all come out
then.”</p>

<p>“And when’s that?”</p>

<p>“It was adjourned to to-day week, if you remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” Roger groaned. “I can’t possibly wait
till then.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if you’d have to, doesn’t it?” said the
inspector, with hypocritical sympathy.</p>

<p>The landlord brought in two pint tankards of beer
and retired again, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Roger raised his. “Well, here’s confusion to you,”
he said with deep gloom.</p>

<p>“Best luck, sir,” returned the inspector politely.</p>

<p>They eyed one another above their respective rims.
Then each set down his tankard and laughed.</p>

<p>“You were going to tell me all the time, weren’t
you?” said Roger confidently.</p>

<p>“Well, I ought not to, you know, Mr. Sheringham,”
the inspector demurred. “Still, I mustn’t forget that it
was you who put me on to the man in the first place,
must I?”</p>

<p>“You must not,” Roger agreed with feeling.</p>

<p>“But this really isn’t for publication, mind. In fact
I’d rather you undertook not to tell a single living soul.
It’s only on that condition I can say anything to you.”</p>

<p>“Not even Anthony?”</p>

<p>“Not even Mr. Walton.”</p>

<p>“Not even Anthony it is, then,” Roger said
cheerfully. “Shoot! What was the poison?”</p>

<p>“Aconitine.”</p>

<p>Roger whistled. “Aconitine, was it? By Jove! That
explains the rapidity, of course. But it’s not exactly
a common one, by any means. Lamson’s specialty,
eh? I wonder how Meadows got hold of it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed the inspector laconically.</p>

<p>“Aconitine!” observed Roger in deep thought. “Well,
well! Of course one of the merits of aconitine is the
smallness of the fatal dose. Somewhere about one-tenth
of a grain, or less, isn’t it? But that doesn’t
usually kill for three or four hours. This must have
been a good deal more than a fatal dose to work so
quickly.”</p>

<p>“It was. At least a grain, Sir Henry reckons.”</p>

<p>“Yes, probably all that. Always the way with the
lay suicide, of course, to give himself about ten times
as much as he needs. You know that better than I do,
no doubt. But aconitine’s about the last thing I was
expecting, I must say. I should have put my money on
arsenic, or strychnine, or even prussic acid; something
more easily procurable than aconitine, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“The symptoms showed it couldn’t be any of those
three.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right; they did, of course. Still
aconitine is a bit unexpected. Weren’t you surprised?”</p>

<p>“I’m never surprised at anything, sir.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you really? <i lang="fr">Blasé</i> fellow! I am, and
aconitine is one of the agents. I wonder how he <em>did</em> manage
to get hold of it. Forged a medical prescription, I
suppose. Have you any idea how he took it? In his
breakfast coffee, or something like that?”</p>

<p>“Sir Henry found no trace of it in any of the
breakfast things.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Did he take it neat, then? Rather unpleasant.
And not very safe either; a grain of the stuff wouldn’t
be much larger than a big pin’s head.”</p>

<p>“Sir Henry found a considerable quantity of it,” said
the inspector steadily, “mixed up with the contents of
the tobacco-jar.”</p>

<p>“The tobacco-jar?” echoed Roger in incredulous
tones.</p>

<p>“He also found it,” pursued the inspector, “in the
pipe which Meadows had been smoking, particularly
in the stem. He says there can be no doubt that that
was the vehicle through which it entered his system.
There was no trace of it in anything else.”</p>

<p>“His—his <em>pipe!</em>” Roger stammered, staring at his
companion with round eyes. “But—but in that
case⸺!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Well—that seems to put suicide almost out of the
question!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed the inspector blandly.</p>

<p>Roger continued to stare at him. “Good Heavens,
you don’t mean⸺?”</p>

<p>“What, sir?”</p>

<p>“That—well, that somebody else poisoned him?”</p>

<p>“There can’t be a shadow of doubt about it,” said
the inspector with the utmost cheerfulness. “The Rev.
Samuel never committed suicide at all. He was
murdered!”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch21">

<h2>Chapter XXI. <br> Roger Plays a Lone Hand</h2>

<p>It was some minutes before Roger would agree
to abandon, once and for all time, his cherished theory
of suicide. Suicide had smoothed all difficulties away;
suicide had explained both deaths in the simplest
possible terms, reduced them to a common denominator;
in spite of superficial appearances surely in some way
it <em>must</em> be suicide. Not until the inspector had patiently,
and for half-a-dozen times in succession, pointed out
that the very last place in which a voluntary consumer
of aconitine would put the poison was among the
contents of his tobacco-jar, and the very last way he would
choose of imbibing it was through the stem of his pipe,
did Roger reluctantly admit that, hang it! yes, it really
did begin to look as if the man had been murdered
after all.</p>

<p>“But you don’t think he was under the impression
that aconitine was a narcotic and that he could smoke
it like opium and so have an easy passage?” he
suggested as a final gleam of hope.</p>

<p>“I do not,” said the inspector, briskly extinguishing
the gleam. “A man who’s going to use a drug like
aconitine at all is going to know something about it;
and the very least he’d know is that it isn’t a narcotic.
No, sir, there’s no other conclusion at all. Meadows was
murdered.”</p>

<p>“Curse the man, then!” Roger observed with feeling.
“He’d simply got no right to be, that’s all I can say.
Now we’re put right back to the beginning again. Well,
who murdered him, Inspector? Perhaps you’ll tell me
that too?”</p>

<p>The inspector tugged at his moustache. “I was hoping
you’d be able to tell me that, Mr. Sheringham.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Roger said bitterly. “I might have known
you weren’t pouring out all this confidential information
for nothing. You want to pick my magnificent brains
again, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you like to put it that way, sir,” remarked
the inspector in deprecating tones.</p>

<p>“I do. I hate calling a pick-axe an ‘agricultural
implement.’ All right, pick away.”</p>

<p>The inspector drank a little beer with a thoughtful
air. “Let’s begin with a motive, then. Now can you see
anyone in the case with a motive for Meadow’s death?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. You still think his death is mixed
up with Mrs. Vane’s? You’re taking that as a
starting-point?”</p>

<p>“Well, we can always keep the other possibility
before us, but it seems a fair enough assumption, wouldn’t
you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the balance of probability is certainly in
favour of it. But I don’t think we ought to forget that
Meadows (we’ll call him Meadows; it’s easier) was
quite possibly a blackmailer, among his other
activities; and once we admit blackmail the field is
enormously widened.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; I’m not forgetting that. But you must
remember that he was certainly down here for some
specific purpose to do with his wife—the coincidence
otherwise would be so great that I think we can wash
it out altogether; so if he <em>was</em> blackmailing, it was
either his wife or somebody very closely connected with
his wife.”</p>

<p>“Such as her husband?”</p>

<p>“Such as Dr. Vane,” said the inspector meticulously.
“Well, you see what I mean. It seems to me we can
take it for granted that his death <em>is</em> due to somebody
already mixed up with the case.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Roger agreed. “I think you’ve clinched that
point.”</p>

<p>“So that brings us back to what I asked you first of
all: can you see anyone in the case with a motive for
getting him out of the way?”</p>

<p>“Plenty!” said Roger promptly. “And the one with
the biggest motive of all was Mrs. Vane herself.”</p>

<p>“Excluding her, I was really meaning,” the inspector
amplified, with quite exemplary patience.</p>

<p>“Well, confining ourselves for the moment to the
blackmail <i lang="fr">motif</i>, I suppose Dr. Vane’s the next on the
list. He’d have plenty of reason to get rid of his wife’s
real husband, especially if he was threatening to give
the whole show away—as he probably was.”</p>

<p>“Even after his wife was dead? What would it
matter to the doctor then?”</p>

<p>“Everything! Nobody likes to be shown up as a
credulous fool, imposed upon by a clever and unscrupulous
woman. Besides, there are bound to be reasons there
that we don’t know anything about, wheels within
wheels. How do we know, for instance, that she hadn’t
somehow made him an accessory to some real breach
of the law? It would be a useful weapon for a woman
in such a precarious position as she was. And Meadows
might have got wind of it.”</p>

<p>“Very ingenious, sir,” the inspector approved. “Yes,
you make out quite a pretty case against the doctor;
though how you’re going to prove it is a different
matter. And now cutting out the blackmail idea—or rather,
taking another aspect of it. Who after all, whether it
was Dr. Vane or not, would have the greatest incentive
to put Meadows out of the way—to ensure his mouth
being shut for ever, if you like?”</p>

<p>Roger nodded slowly. “I see. Yes; of course. And
we know Meadows was on the spot at the time; I was
forgetting that. Yes, certainly that’s the strongest
motive of all.”</p>

<p>“That’s how I look at it, anyway,” said the inspector
cheerfully. “In fact, the way I see it is this. Meadows
was in that little cave at the time, probably waiting to
keep an appointment with his wife. Along she comes,
but—with somebody else; not alone. Naturally he lies
low; doesn’t want his name connected with hers at all;
that might be killing the goose with the golden eggs.
And while he’s waiting, this other person pushes his
wife over the cliff—<em>and he knows who that person is</em>.”</p>

<p>“A masterly reconstruction,” Roger commented.
“So although the original goose is killed, the gander that
did it has delivered himself into his hands; and
contrary to all the laws of nature, that gander is going
to be made to shell out golden eggs just as fast as a
sausage-machine!”</p>

<p>“That’s one way of putting it,” the inspector smiled.
“But the gander thinks differently, and⸺”</p>

<p>“As Samuel is promptly despatched to fresh meadows
and pastures new!—Well, yes, Inspector, one must
admit that’s a sound enough theory, and very cogently
stated.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem to you the only reasonable theory,
sir? Or at any rate, the most reasonable?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it does,” Roger said thoughtfully. “Yes,
the most reasonable, without doubt. So now we come
back to the good old problem, which I solved so
extremely neatly last week—who killed Mrs. Vane?”</p>

<p>“We do, sir. And as to that, do you see one big fact
in this second case which is going to give us a valuable
pointer to the identity of the double murderer?”</p>

<p>“This is as good as a correspondence course,” Roger
murmured: “ ‘How to Be a Detective,’ in three
lessons—Yes, Teacher, I do. Aconitine.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir. It must have been somebody who
had access to aconitine; I think we can take <em>that</em> for
granted. I shall make enquiries at the chemist’s in
Sandsea and elsewhere, of course, as a matter of form; but
I don’t fancy they’ll lead to anything. The murderer
knew all about poisons; that’s obvious. Something was
wanted that would act quickly, so the choice was
practically limited to prussic acid, strychnine, aconitine and
curare. Prussic acid smells too strong, so the man could
hardly be induced to take it unsuspectingly; with
strychnine he’d shout out and make too much fuss;
curare won’t act except on an open wound; aconitine
(a <em>big</em> dose of aconitine, that is) was just what was
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Roger said seriously, stroking his chin.
“I see what you’re getting at, of course. But do you
really think he⸺”</p>

<p>“Hullo, you two!” said a voice from the door. “Still
yapping? Hope you’ve got something to drink up here.
I’ve got a throat like a mustard plaster after walking
along that road in this heat.”</p>

<p>“Anthony,” said his cousin with not unjustified
annoyance, “you’re gross.”</p>

<p>The conversation swerved abruptly from matters
criminal.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lying in bed that night, Roger did not get to sleep
very quickly. Apart from this fresh development of the
case which in itself was enough to prolong his
meditations well into the small hours, he had another problem
to engage his attention scarcely less closely—<em>why</em> had
the inspector emerged, practically unbidden, from his
shell of reticence and volunteered this startling
information? The pretext of picking his amateur
colleague’s brains was of course only an empty excuse, for
in the subsequent discussion it was the inspector who
had taken the lead, pointed out the possibilities and
established a workable theory; Roger had contributed
nothing of any value to it. Why, in other words, had
the inspector gone out of his way to drop unmistakable
hints that the author of both crimes was Dr. Vane
himself? It was only as he was at last dropping off to sleep
that an illuminating answer occurred to him—the
inspector had done this because that is what he wished
Roger to think: his real theory was something entirely
different!</p>

<hr>

<p>Shaving the next morning, Roger pursued this train
of thought. That certainly was the explanation of the
inspector’s otherwise inexplicable conduct. Laughing
maliciously up his sleeve, he had been trying to head
the officious journalist, against whom he already had
a score to pay, not toward the truth but away from
it. Roger grinned at his reflection in the mirror: very
well, but two could play at that game. Likewise,
forewarned was forearmed. He began to ponder a plan of
campaign which should end in extracting the wind from
the inspector’s sails.</p>

<p>Obviously the only thing to do was to go straight
ahead with his investigations as if nothing had been
said. It was possible of course that Dr. Vane really was
the murderer, although the inspector clearly did not
think so. Nor for that matter did Roger himself. Not
that Dr. Vane struck him as likely to shrink from
murder if murder should be necessary, but somehow he
did not <em>feel</em> him as the murderer of his wife—he could
put it no more reasonably than that; the eliminator of
Meadows, yes, quite possibly; but not the other.</p>

<p>And in that connection, was it so unlikely that the
two deaths should have been brought about by different
agents? The inspector had pretended to think so and
had certainly made out a strong case to support his
hypothesis, but did that not now point all the more
strongly to the opposite conclusion? The inspector had
been at some pains even to labour the point; all the
more reason therefore to suspect that his real opinion
was just the opposite. Well, well, things did seem to be
getting really very involved. The only way of
straightening them out was to keep a clear head, forget no
possibilities and yet allow none to bias him unduly—and
might the best sleuth win!</p>

<p>Roger brushed his hair with his usual care, put on
his coat and walked demurely down to breakfast.</p>

<p>The inspector was already half-way through his meal,
and Anthony had not put in an appearance. For ten
minutes the two exchanged platitudes, the topic bulking
largest in both of their minds being as if by common
consent avoided. Then the inspector mumbled something
about having a busy day in front of him and took his
departure. Almost simultaneously Anthony entered the
room.</p>

<p>Roger helped himself to marmalade and watched
Anthony scoop the remainder of the dish of bacon and
eggs on to his plate. He had devoted some earnest
thought between platitudes during the last ten minutes
to the promise the inspector had extracted from him
the evening before, and while deprecating any
temptation to break it even in the circumstances, fancied that
he had found a blameless way round it. “Anthony,” he
began with some care, “you’re on duty this morning.”</p>

<p>“Right-ho!” said Anthony with equanimity. “But
what’s the idea? Nothing for us to do, is there?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” Roger said, with elaborate carelessness.
“At least, nothing <em>necessary;</em> just something I’d rather
like to play about with. To tell you the truth, Anthony,
I’m getting a little tired of this enforced idleness, so
I’ve propounded a neat little puzzle to myself. It’s
this: suppose Meadows turned out after all not to have
committed suicide, but to have been murdered!”</p>

<p>“Suppose the moon turned into pink cheese too,”
responded Anthony jocularly. “All right, I’ll suppose
that. What about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, it <em>is</em> a possibility,” Roger said,
with an air of trying to convince himself against his
reason. “We ought not to lose sight of it just because it
seems improbable. And it would be remarkably
interesting if we could make out some sort of a case to
support it, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Is that what you want to do?” Anthony asked,
cutting himself a second slice of bread. “Seems a bit of a
waste of time to me. However, I’m game if you want
to amuse yourself. Things have been a bit quiet lately,
haven’t they?”</p>

<p>Roger glanced at his cousin in some surprise, but
tactfully forebore to comment on this remarkable statement.
It had been his impression that things had not
been at all quiet lately, so far as Anthony and his affairs
were concerned. “You haven’t fixed anything up with
Margaret for this morning, then?” was all he said.</p>

<p>“No,” said Anthony very airily. “She’s got to go
into Sandsea, I believe. Shopping, or some rot. I shan’t
be seeing her till to-morrow, if then.”</p>

<p>Again Roger, with almost superhuman tact this time,
refrained from comment. It was on the tip of his tongue
to say, “What have you quarrelled about now, you pair
of idiots?” but he didn’t. For one thing he had no wish
to be accompanied all the morning by a glowering and
resentful Anthony.</p>

<p>“That’s all right then,” he remarked briskly, as if for
Anthony and Margaret not to meet during a whole
twenty-four hours was quite the most ordinary thing in
the world. “Well, I’ll tell you what we’ll do. I think
it would be rather fun, to say nothing of the exercise
in detectiveship, to assume for one day that Meadows
was murdered (poisoned, of course) and see if we can
collect any evidence in support of the notion. What do
you say?”</p>

<p>“Frightful fun,” Anthony agreed mechanically.</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit,” said Roger with great heartiness.
“Very well, then; hurry up with your breakfast, and
we’ll see what the Queen will send us.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII. <br> New Discoveries</h2>

<p>Roger and Anthony stood in the sitting-room
that had been occupied by the Rev. Meadows, while
the stout landlady entertained them with a ceaseless
flow of reminiscences concerning her late guest.
Anthony’s face was already feeling the strain of
keeping an expression of polite interest held firmly toward
this stream of verbiage; Roger was blatantly paying
not the slightest attention. Anthony began to realise why
his cousin had been so anxious to bring him.</p>

<p>“Never was a one for making a fuss, neither,” the
stout landlady assured Anthony with considerable
emphasis. “Not never, he wasn’t! Always got a pleasant
word for me when I’d bring his meals in or come to ask
him if he wanted anything, like. Make a little joke too,
he would, as often as not. Very fond of his little joke,
the Rev. Meadows was. Sometimes I couldn’t help but
laugh at him, he’d say such comical things. Seems
dreadful to think of now, doesn’t it, sir, with the poor
gentleman lying stiff and cold in his grave, as you might
say?” She paused momentarily for breath.</p>

<p>“Very dreadful,” Anthony agreed, casting a
harassed eye at a pink china pig on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Roger, who had been gazing thoughtfully out of the
low window, turned round. “Did anybody come to see
Mr. Meadows before breakfast on the morning of his
death?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>The landlady was so taken aback that she answered
with equal brevity. “No, sir, that there wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure, sir,” replied the landlady, recovering
herself. “You see, I was in me kitchen from⸺”</p>

<p>“Did he have a visitor on the previous day, do you
remember?” Roger cut in ruthlessly.</p>

<p>“No, sir; he never had a visitor all the time he was
here, not till you came. Very quiet gentleman, he was;
very quiet. I remember saying to Mrs. Mullins, not
three days before the end, ‘Mrs. Mullins,’ I said, ‘there’s
lodgers <em>and</em> lodgers, as you know as well as I do, but the
Rev. Meadows, he⸺’ ”</p>

<p>“Did you go to bed early the night before Mr.
Meadows’ death?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“Well, in good time, as you might say,” replied the
landlady, instantly directing her steady stream along
this new course. “But then I always do. Candle out by
ten o’clock’s my rule and always has been. An hour’s
sleep before midnight’s worth two after, I always say.
Now my husband, when he was alive, would sit⸺”</p>

<p>“So if Mr. Meadows had had a late visitor, you
wouldn’t have known?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir,” said the
stout landlady, in no wise disconcerted, “because as a
matter of fact I <em>should</em> have known. I should have
heard the bell, you see. Because I didn’t get to sleep
after all that night, not till it was quite light I didn’t.
I had the toothache something chronic. I do get like
that sometimes, and then it’s as much as I can do to get
a wink of sleep at all. I remember it was that night,
because when I heard about poor Mr. Meadows the next
morning, well, troubles never come singly, I thought.
Not but what I know the toothache oughtn’t to be
mentioned in the same breath as⸺”</p>

<p>“But supposing the visitor hadn’t rung the bell,”
Roger persisted. “Supposing he’d come round and
tapped at this window and Mr. Meadows had gone to
the door and let him in. You wouldn’t have known
anything about it then, would you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir, too, because
as it happens I <em>should</em> have. I should have heard them
talking in here, you see. My bedroom’s just above this
room, and you can hear the voices through the ceiling
as plain as plain. Not what they’re saying, I don’t
mean, but just the voices. And I know <em>that</em>,” continued
the landlady with an air of mild triumph, “because I
heard it meself a matter of three weeks ago or more,
when someone did come to see Mr. Meadows after I’d
gone to bed, just like you said.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Someone did come to see him, eh? But I thought
you said he’d had no visitors?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did,” admitted the landlady handsomely,
“and that’s a fact. But not having let this one in meself,
well, it slipped my memory, I suppose. Yes, the Rev.
Meadows did have a visitor one night, and I know that
although I’d gone to sleep, because they woke me up
with their talking.”</p>

<p>“It was pretty late, then, and they were talking
loudly. Good! Have you any idea who it was?”</p>

<p>The landlady hesitated. “No, sir, I couldn’t say that,
I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“What could you say, though?” Roger asked, with his
most winning smile.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’m not a one for scandal,” said the
landlady rapidly; “never have been, and please God never
will be. But this I must and will say: if it’d been
anybody else but the Rev. Meadows I should’ve gone down
to them then and there, in bed though I was and
goodness knows tired enough already. My house has always
been respectable and I look upon it as me duty to keep
it respectable, but seeing it was the Rev. Meadows—well,
what’s wrong for other people would be right for
him, I thought. Being a clergyman does make a
difference, doesn’t it, sir? So I just shut me eyes⸺”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” Roger put in gently, “that Mr.
Meadows’ visitor was a lady?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that, sir,” said the
landlady doubtfully. “I don’t know whether you’d call her
a <em>lady</em>. You see, she was talking that loud I could hardly
get to sleep again, try as I might. And the Rev.
Meadows, he was talking louder than a clergyman ought, if
you ask me, sir. Not but what we ought to say any good
of the dead, as the saying goes, and the Rev. Meadows
always being such a pleasant, soft-spoken gentleman in
the ordinary way, but⸺”</p>

<p>“Were they quarrelling, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose if you put it like that, sir,” said the
landlady with reluctance, “they were.”</p>

<p>Roger exchanged a significant look with Anthony.
“And you haven’t the least idea who the lady was?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir; I don’t know who she was. I never saw
her, you see, and she didn’t leave nothing behind her,
only a handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“She left a handkerchief, did she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I found it the next morning, when I was
doing this room before Mr. Meadows was up. I meant
to give it to him to give back to her, but kept putting it
off somehow. I thought, perhaps, he mightn’t like me
knowing anything about it, you see, him not having said
a word about her being here at all; and after all, least
said soonest mended, as the saying goes.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t,” said Roger, with elaborate
carelessness, “still got that handkerchief by you, have you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir, because
just as it happens, I have. I kep’ it by me, you see,
meaning⸺”</p>

<p>“Would it be too much trouble to let me have a look
at it for a moment?” Roger asked in honeyed tones.</p>

<p>“Not a bit, sir,” replied the landlady cheerfully.
“I’ll go and get it now, if you wouldn’t mind waiting a
minute.”</p>

<p>She bustled out of the room, and Anthony looked at
his cousin with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vane, of course?” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Roger nodded. “She could easily get in
at that window without being seen.”</p>

<p>“But it’s natural enough, isn’t it? I mean, why the
excitement?”</p>

<p>“I’m not excited. And it is perfectly natural. She
probably came here several times. But having unearthed
a brand-new fact, we may as well find out all there is to
be known about it. I admit that I don’t see any fresh
development that it can lead to, but there’s no harm in
following it up.”</p>

<p>The landlady bustled back again, decidedly the worse
for breath, and handed Roger a small piece of cambric
entirely surrounded by lace. Roger examined it and
silently pointed out to Anthony a small E embroidered
in one corner. He turned to the landlady and
significantly rattled his loose change.</p>

<p>“I’d like to keep this, if I may,” he told her.</p>

<p>“And welcome,” responded the landlady with
alacrity. If her visitors were ready to pay good cash for such
an insignificant souvenir of the tragedy, who was she
to stand in their way?</p>

<p>“I suppose you can’t say at all definitely which
evening it was, can you?” Roger asked, tucking the flimsy
thing away in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can, sir,” returned the landlady, not without
triumph. “It was the very night before that poor Mrs.
Vane was thrown over the cliff. That fixed it in my
memory, like. Wasn’t that a dreadful thing, sir? Really,
I don’t know what’s happening to Ludmouth. First Mrs.
Vane and then the Rev. Meadows! Do you think that
police-inspector is going to find out anything, sir? You
being with him last week and all, I thought
perhaps⸺”</p>

<p>Roger discouraged her inquisitiveness with gentle
firmness and began to prowl round the room. The excuse
he had given for his presence, that the dead man was an
old friend of his, could be easily stretched to cover any
curiosity, bordering on the indecent, which he might
display regarding that old friend’s habits and
possessions.</p>

<p>A rack on the wall containing three or four pipes
arrested his attention, and he drew one out of its socket.
“Mr. Meadows was a heavy smoker, wasn’t he?” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir,” observed
the landlady, who had been following his movements
with interest, “because I shouldn’t have said he was,
meself, at all. Leastways, not compared with my
husband, he wasn’t. He’d smoke his pipe after breakfast,
the Rev. Meadows would, and again after his dinner
and perhaps a bit in the evening if he felt like it, but
not much more than that. Now my husband; you’d
hardly ever see him without he had a pipe in⸺”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Meadows had a lot of pipes for so small
a smoker?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, he had, sir; I’d noticed that meself. But
he was very funny about his pipes, the Rev. Meadows
was. He used to smoke them one at a time, for a week;
in roteration, he called it. Very comical about it, he
was too. ‘Pipes are like wives, ma,’ he used to say
(always called me ma, he did; said I mothered him better
than his own mother ever had; a very friendly sort of
gentleman, the Rev. Meadows was). Yes, ‘Pipes are like
wives,’ he’d say; ‘a man ought never to have more than
one of ’em going at a time.’ That was just one of his
comicalities, you see. Always full of jokes like that, he
was. ‘Pipes are like wives,’ indeed! You see what he
meant: a man ought never⸺”</p>

<p>“Yes, very comical indeed,” Roger agreed gravely.
“Ha, ha! By the way, you don’t know where Mr.
Meadows bought his tobacco, do you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir, because as
it happens I do. Next door but one the shop is, and that’s
the only place they sell it in the village. Barring the
Three Swans and the Crown, of course; and the Three
Swans being over a mile outside the village, you could
hardly expect him to go there for it, could you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Roger agreed with an air of great
seriousness. “No, I couldn’t possibly expect that. Well,
I mustn’t keep you any longer, I suppose. Thank you
so much for letting me look round.” He held something
out toward her which the landlady received with ready
palm.</p>

<p>“And welcome, I’m sure,” she said genially. “Thank
you kindly, sir. And if there’s anything else you want
to see, you’ve only got to ask. Wouldn’t like to have a
look round his bedroom, I suppose, now you’re here?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think we need trouble about that. Come
along, Anthony. Good-morning, madam.”</p>

<p>They were shown into the road and Roger turned to
the left.</p>

<p>“Some day,” remarked Anthony chattily, “I must
match you against that woman, if I can find somebody
to put up a purse. You’ll enter the ring directly after
breakfast and talk to each other till one of you gives up.
If either of the combatants is found at the time of the
contest to be suffering already from clergyman’s sore
throat, he or she forfeits the stake-money and all bets
are null and void. Queensbury rules, no kidney-punch,
towels and sponges to be provided by⸺”</p>

<p>“Cease prattling, Anthony,” Roger remarked in
tolerant tones, diving into a shop in their left. “We’re
going in here.”</p>

<p>They went in.</p>

<p>“By the way,” Roger opened the conversation, having
paved the way by buying an ounce of tobacco that he
didn’t want. “By the way, this is the same brand as poor
Mr. Meadows used to smoke, isn’t it? You remember;
the clergyman who died next door but one last week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” said the village grocer. “We all knew
him here. But he didn’t smoke that, sir. Crown and
Anchor Coarse Cut was what he always bought.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? I thought he told me once that he
smoked this. But of course he never did smoke very
much.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir. About an ounce a week, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Used to come in here for his ounce every week,
did he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he didn’t do that. He used to buy it a
quarter-of-a-pound at a time; but that works at an ounce
a week, you see.”</p>

<p>“So it does,” observed Roger with an air of mild
surprise, and took his departure.</p>

<p>“So now, Anthony,” he confided to that young man
outside, “we know what Samuel smoked, how he treated
his pipes, how much tobacco he bought at a time and
everything else; in fact, about the only thing we appear
not to know in this connection is the name of Samuel’s
tobacconist’s cousin’s great-aunt’s cat.”</p>

<p>“And what the deuce,” wondered Anthony, “do you
imagine you’re going to get out of it all?”</p>

<p>“That Heaven alone knows!” replied Roger, with
pious agnosticism.</p>

<p>They went back to the inn for lunch.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch23">

<h2>Chapter XXIII. <br> Colin Upsets the Apple-cart</h2>

<p>Inspector Moresby was evidently having a busy
day. He did not put in an appearance at lunch, and
when Roger and Anthony strolled down to the
sea-level to smoke their post-prandial pipes there was still
no sign of him. Anthony surmised vaguely that his
investigations must be covering a larger field than their
own.</p>

<p>Anthony had plenty of time for his surmises, for ever
since their return to the inn Roger had lapsed into a
highly unaccustomed state of taciturnity. To his
cousin’s efforts to make conversation or discuss their
discoveries of the morning he replied with only a brief
word or grunt. Anthony, who was not always so tactless
as he appeared, realised that his mind was busy with
some knotty problem connected with the case, and was
content to leave him to his meditations. They scrambled
out to their usual rock and composed themselves to
smoke in silence.</p>

<p>It was nearly three-quarters of an hour before Roger
volunteered any clue as to what was puzzling him.
“I’m sure,” he said abruptly, “that this information of
the landlady’s ought to give us a pointer to the truth,
if we could only interpret it correctly.”</p>

<p>“You mean, about Mrs. Vane’s visit and their
quarrel?” Anthony enquired.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Roger said with unusual testiness. “That
doesn’t give us anything fresh. It’s natural enough for
her to have visited him, and we’d gathered already that
they were on bad terms. No, about those pipes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! But I don’t see how they come in.”</p>

<p>“Well, after all,” observed Roger sarcastically, “a
pipe does play rather a leading part in the affair,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” asked
Anthony blankly.</p>

<p>Roger stared at him for a moment and then laughed.
“Oh, sorry! I was forgetting that you don’t know
anything about that. And you mustn’t ask me either, because
I’m under the most fearful oaths of secrecy. Anyhow,
a pipe <em>does</em> play a leading part—but don’t tell Moresby
I told you.”</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word,” agreed Anthony cheerfully. “All
right, carry on, then. You’ll get to the bottom of it,
Roger, if you work your grey matter hard enough.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Anthony,” Roger murmured. “I do
need a little encouragement, it’s true.” He relapsed into
his brown study.</p>

<p>Anthony sat on the rock till it became too hard to sit
on any longer, then he removed his shoes and socks,
tucked up his trousers and began to wander further
afield. Anthony was growing up.</p>

<p>High overhead an aeroplane made its appearance,
sweeping a vast circle in the blue sky. The drone of its
engine reached their ears as a muffled hum.</p>

<p>“Wonder if that’s Woodthorpe’s bus,” Anthony called
out, seeing his cousin’s eyes following the tiny speck
across space.</p>

<p>“Woodthorpe’s?” said Roger absently. “Didn’t know
he’d got one.”</p>

<p>“So Margaret told me. He was in the Air Force
during the war, and now he keeps a bus of his own. They’re
rolling in money, of course.”</p>

<p>“Lucky devils,” remarked Roger mechanically.</p>

<p>Anthony found a small crab under a flat stone and the
conversation lapsed.</p>

<p>It was another half-hour before Roger again broke
the silence. He rose from his cramped position and
made his way over to Anthony, jumping agilely from
rock to rock and refilling his pipe as he went.</p>

<p>“Look here, Anthony,” he said, “is there absolutely
no way of getting hold of Margaret this afternoon?
There’s something I particularly want to ask her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is,” Anthony replied doubtfully.
“I wanted to take her out in the car, as a matter of fact,
but she said she couldn’t possibly manage it; far too
busy.”</p>

<p>“She’s gone into Sandsea, you said?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Roger frowned. “What an infernal nuisance! It’s a
point I badly want to clear up.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask her whether by any remote chance
Mrs. Vane had expressed any intention before her death
of going away in the near future.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s funny you should say that, sir,” replied
Anthony humorously, “because as a matter of fact I <em>do</em>
know. She had. What’s the great idea?”</p>

<p>“She had, had she?” Roger demanded eagerly. “Did
Margaret tell you?”</p>

<p>“She mentioned it once, I remember; just casually.
Mrs. Vane hadn’t been away this summer, and she was
going to stay with some friends for the twelfth.”</p>

<p>“The twelfth, eh?” Roger made a rapid calculation.
“Then she’d have gone about a fortnight ago. Excellent!
Anthony, I do believe I’m on the track of something.”</p>

<p>“I say, are you really?” Anthony’s enthusiasm was
all that the most exacting detective could have required.
“Mean you’ve solved the whole thing?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,” Roger
said modestly. “But I do think I’m beginning to see
daylight. I’ve got a rather stupendous idea, at any rate,
and things seem to be fitting into it rather neatly.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t ask me that yet. I shall have to chew
it over a lot more before I can make a connected and
logical story of it. Besides, the best detectives always
hold up their brilliant solutions for the most effective
moment (surely you know that), and I refuse to think
that an audience of Anthony Walton, two green crabs
and a limpet would be in the least effective.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up and think it out properly,” said
Anthony, ignoring this pleasantry. “You know we all want
to see this damned business cleared up once and for
all.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go back and have our tea. And after that,
if you’ll leave me to myself for a couple of hours, I’ll
see what can be done.”</p>

<p>Inspector Moresby had still not returned to the inn
when they got there, as the landlord informed them
on Roger’s enquiry. Roger wondered uneasily what
exactly he might be up to; feeling as he did that he
himself was on the verge of the truth he had no wish that
anybody should forestall him in crossing it.</p>

<p>Throughout tea he chattered incessantly about
nothing at all, explaining on Anthony’s remonstrance that
he wished to clear his brain of all stale notions in order
to approach the problem afterward with an entirely
fresh mind.</p>

<p>As soon as they had finished he took his pipe down
once more to the rocks, and sternly forbade Anthony to
come within half-a-mile of him.</p>

<p>More than the stipulated two hours had passed before
he climbed once more up to the little path along the
face of the cliff and thence to the top of the headland
where Anthony, bored beyond tears with his own
company but far too eager to risk missing his cousin’s
return, was anxiously waiting.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded the latter at once, hurrying
forward. “Any luck?”</p>

<p>“Not so much luck, Anthony, as brilliance,” Roger
replied with pardonable pride. “Yes, I think I’ve solved
this little problem, as Holmes would have said if he’d
been here instead of me.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the murderer, then?”</p>

<p>“Can you possess your soul in patience a little
longer? I don’t want to spoil a good story, but it’s such
a long and complicated one that I don’t want to have
to tell it twice over. If you can wait till Moresby
arrives I can kill two birds with one stone.”</p>

<p>“But he may be ages,” Anthony grumbled.</p>

<p>“Well, give me till half-way through supper,” said
Roger, “and if he isn’t back by then I’ll promise to
give you an outline of it in advance.” And with that
Anthony had to be content.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” Roger resumed, as they walked back to
the inn. “By Jove, I do hope Moresby hasn’t been
working along this line himself. He’s such a reticent devil, I
never know what’s in his mind; he’ll spill a fact or two
occasionally, but never a theory—that is, not without
some ulterior motive. Yes, if this idea hasn’t occurred
to him already, I fancy I’ve got a little shock in store
for Inspector Moresby.”</p>

<p>“Is the solution quite—quite unexpected, then?”</p>

<p>“Entirely, so far as I know—or at any rate, by me.
Then I suddenly caught a glimpse of things from a fresh
angle, and all the facts proceeded to arrange themselves
in the neatest way possible.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be able to convince the inspector, I suppose?
He’s a bit of a sceptical devil.”</p>

<p>“He is that,” Roger agreed with feeling. “But I don’t
see how I can fail to convince even him. The facts ought
to do that for themselves. Of course the solution isn’t
capable of cast-iron proof, that’s the only trouble; but
if it comes to that, what solution that depends only
on circumstantial evidence ever can be? And proof
hasn’t necessarily got to be cast-iron, it only needs to
be reasonably convincing; and that mine certainly is.”</p>

<p>“Good egg!” quoth Anthony with satisfaction.</p>

<p>In the hall of the inn the landlord intercepted them.</p>

<p>“There’s a gentleman come to see Inspector
Moresby,” he said. “I told him he was out, but he
wanted to wait, so I said he could wait in your
sitting-room, thinking you wouldn’t mind, gents.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” Roger concurred. “Did he leave his
name?”</p>

<p>“Well, there wasn’t no need for him to do that,”
replied the landlord quite seriously. “I know who ’e is,
you see. It’s young Mr. Woodthorpe.”</p>

<p>Roger and Anthony exchanged glances. “Oh, yes?”
said the former. “Well, no doubt the inspector will be
in soon. Thank you, landlord.—And what the devil,”
he observed to Anthony, as they made their way up the
stairs, “does young Mr. Woodthorpe want? We’d better
go in and see.”</p>

<p>Young Mr. Woodthorpe was standing by the window,
his usually ruddy face decidedly pale and set in grim
lines. He wheeled round abruptly as they entered the
room.</p>

<p>“Hullo! You wanted to see Inspector Moresby?”
Roger greeted him pleasantly.</p>

<p>Woodthorpe nodded. “Yes,” he said curtly. “Will he
be long?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, I’m afraid. We haven’t seen him since
breakfast. Is it anything important?”</p>

<p>“It is rather.”</p>

<p>“Well, have a drink while you’re waiting. I can
recommend the beer here.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Anthony, shout down for three tankards,” Roger
said hospitably, quite unperturbed by his guest’s
noticeable failure to return his own cordiality; indeed the
young man’s manner was so abrupt and cold as to be
not far short of downright rude.</p>

<p>Anthony’s stentorian shout echoed down the dark
stairs.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I give the inspector a message, if he’s
longer than you care to wait?” Roger asked, turning
back to Woodthorpe.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said the young man stiffly. “My
business with him is rather private.” He swallowed
slightly and swept a nervous glance toward the door,
through which Anthony was just returning. “Oh, well,”
he burst out with sudden defiance, “you’ll know soon
enough in any case, so I may as well tell you now. I’ve
come to give myself up. I killed Mrs. Vane and—and
Meadows.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned!” said Roger blankly.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV. <br> Inspector Moresby Is Humorous</h2>

<p>It is not an easy exercise in hospitality to
entertain a guest who has just announced that he is a double
murderer. Small talk about the weather and the
latest books seems something of an anticlimax, while
to display a polite interest in his hobby and question
him as to details might be misconstrued as mere
indecent curiosity. On the whole it is difficult to see how the
situation (should it ever occur to the reader) could
be better handled than it was by Roger.</p>

<p>“Did you really?” observed that gentleman politely,
pulling himself together with an effort as the three
tankards preceded the landlord into the room. “Well,
well!—er—cheerio!”</p>

<p>“Cheerio!” echoed the self-confessed murderer
gloomily, and extracted what comfort he could from his
tankard.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” mumbled Roger, still
mechanically polite.</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>The trio seated themselves and looked at one another
in silence.</p>

<p>“The—the inspector ought to be here soon, I should
think,” volunteered Roger helpfully.</p>

<p>“Will he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>There was another pause. Roger frowned at Anthony.
Anthony continued to preserve unbroken silence; the
situation was evidently beyond him.</p>

<p>It was rather beyond Roger too, but he flung himself
valiantly into the breach once more. “Have you been
waiting long?” he enquired desperately.</p>

<p>“Not very.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—Well—he ought to be in any minute now.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>There was another pause.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Roger still more desperately, “what
are we to talk about?”</p>

<p>Woodthorpe smiled faintly. “I suppose it is a bit
awkward for you fellows,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Infernally awkward,” Roger agreed warmly. “I
don’t know what the etiquette is on these occasions at all.
Besides, they’ll be coming in to lay the supper in a
minute. Shall I tell them to lay a place for you, by the
way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. That rather depends on the inspector,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think he’ll allow you to have some
food at any rate, whatever he does with you afterward.
I’ll tell the girl when she comes up. In the meantime, if
you don’t care for talking here’s the morning paper.”</p>

<p>Colin Woodthorpe smiled again. “Thanks,” he said
and began to read it diligently, upside-down.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I’d better go along and wash,” Roger
observed very airily. “Coming, Anthony?”</p>

<p>They escaped from the room.</p>

<p>“Was this your solution, Roger?” Anthony asked,
when they had gained the privacy of one of their four
bedrooms.</p>

<p>“Don’t rub it in!” Roger groaned. “And I’d got it all
worked out so beautifully. Dash it, I can’t believe I was
wrong! I wonder if the chap can be making a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Fellow ought to know whether he’s murdered
somebody or not, surely,” Anthony stated judicially.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose he ought. It would be a difficult thing
to overlook, wouldn’t it? Well, all I can say is, dash the
chap! This is the second time I’ve solved this mystery
wrong.—Anthony, I don’t want to go back to that room
a bit. Let’s sit down and smoke and talk about Ibsen.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go down and tell them about that extra place
first,” said Anthony, and extricated himself with
neatness and despatch.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the maid knocked on the door
and informed them that supper was ready. With
reluctance they returned to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Their guest was by this time a little more composed,
and a scrappy conversation upon various subjects of no
interest at all was determinedly maintained. Nevertheless
it was with considerable relief that Roger hailed the
arrival of Inspector Moresby ten minutes later. He did
not wish to see young Woodthorpe, to whom he had
taken a liking, being bundled off to prison, but the
situation really was a very difficult one.</p>

<p>Woodthorpe jumped to his feet immediately the door
opened. “Inspector,” he said, with a return to his former
abrupt manner, “I’ve been waiting to see you. I want to
give myself up for the murders of Mrs. Vane and
Meadows.”</p>

<p>The inspector gazed at him coolly for a moment.
Then he closed the door behind him. “Oh, you do, do
you?” he said without emotion. “So it was you who did
it after all, was it, Mr. Woodthorpe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the inspector tolerantly, “boys will
be boys, I suppose. What’s for supper, eh, Mr.
Sheringham?”</p>

<p>“C-cold veal and salad,” stammered Roger, somewhat
taken aback. He had never seen an experienced
policeman arresting a murderer before, but this certainly did
not coincide with his ideas of how it should be done.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope the salad’s better than it was last
night,” observed the inspector with some severity, and
took his seat at the table.</p>

<p>Roger was not the only person to whom things did
not seem to be going right. “Well, aren’t you going to
arrest me, Inspector?” asked Woodthorpe in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“All in good time, sir, all in good time,” replied the
inspector, busying himself with the veal. “Business first
and pleasure afterward, perhaps, but food before either
of them.”</p>

<p>“And drink before that,” murmured Roger, who was
beginning to recover himself. Roger thought he saw a
gleam of light in the darkness.</p>

<p>Woodthorpe dropped back into his seat. “I—I don’t
understand,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You’ve got no salad, sir,” said the inspector in tones
of some concern. “Help yourself and then pass the bowl
across to me.—Well, well! So it’s you who’s been giving
us all this trouble, is it?”</p>

<p>“If you like to put it that way,” replied Woodthorpe
stiffly. Certainly it must be galling to any conscientious
murderer, who has just brought off a neat right and left,
to hear his exploit described merely as ‘troublesome.’
There is nobody like an inspector of police for showing
things up as they prosaically are.</p>

<p>“And why did you suddenly make up your mind to
come and tell me all about it, sir?” pursued the
inspector, with the air of one making polite conversation.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that I’m called upon to give you my
reasons.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” the inspector agreed with the utmost
heartiness. “Worst thing in the world you could do.
Never give reasons, that’s my advice. Have some more
veal? Mr. Walton, you’ve finished; cut Mr. Woodthorpe
some more veal.”</p>

<p>Anthony, who had been watching this exchange with
open mouth, started violently and began to cut the bread.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any more veal, thank you,” said Mr.
Woodthorpe, flushing angrily.</p>

<p>“Just as you like, sir, of course,” murmured the
inspector, and bestowed a large wink on Roger.</p>

<p>Roger, to whom the gleam of light had now become
a broad beam, returned the wink with interest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Woodthorpe intercepted both. He
sprang wrathfully to his feet again, knocking his chair
over behind him. “Look here,” he burst out, “I’ve had
about enough of this fooling. I told you what I came
here for, Inspector. Are you going to arrest me or are
you not?”</p>

<p>The inspector looked up from his plate. “Well, sir,”
he said blandly, “since you ask me so candidly—no, I’m
not!—But I’d like to ask you a few questions, perhaps.”</p>

<p>For a long moment the eyes of the two men held each
other, while a deep flush slowly overspread the younger’s
face. Then Woodthorpe turned away and marched over
to the door.</p>

<p>“Then you can jolly well come up to my home and
ask me them there,” he announced as he opened it. “I’ve
had about enough of this.” The door closed behind him
with a bang.</p>

<p>“That looks like a walk for me, I’m afraid,” observed
the inspector with regret.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Roger laughed. “He got one back on you
there, Inspector.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Anthony. “Good Lord!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Anthony?” Roger asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“You mean—that chap never did it at all?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that, Anthony,” said Roger with a
grave face. “It’s simply that Inspector Moresby has a
conscientious objection to arresting anybody for murder
under the age of thirty.”</p>

<p>“Ass!” growled his cousin, and helped himself to
stewed gooseberries. “Well, what about your story now,
then? Did you know Roger had solved the mystery,
Inspector?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Walton, I didn’t,” said the inspector with
interest. “Has he?”</p>

<p>“Well, he thinks he has,” said Anthony nastily.</p>

<p>“Now, now, Anthony,” Roger reproved. “Don’t be
vindictive.—Yes,” he added modestly to the inspector.
“I’ve solved the mystery all right. And I warn you that
I’m going to telephone part of it at any rate to London
to-night, though not the bit you wanted suppressed for
the present, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said the inspector. “These gooseberries
seem to me a bit sour, didn’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Inspector Moresby,” said Roger with heat, “there
are some people for whose murder it’s well worth while
to be hanged. You’re one of them. So take this as a
friendly warning and don’t try me too far.”</p>

<p>“But they are a bit sour, Mr. Sheringham,” protested
the inspector. “Really!”</p>

<p>“So are the grapes too, I’m afraid,” Roger grinned.
“Never mind, Inspector; perhaps I shan’t be on your
next case.—So the story-books are right after all when
they talk about Scotland Yard’s professional jealousy of
the amateur.”</p>

<p>“True, sir,” said the inspector, shaking his head.
“Terribly true.”</p>

<p>“See in the paper this morning that Glamorgan have
won their eleventh match this season, Anthony?” Roger
remarked airily. “Extraordinary how they’ve come on,
isn’t it? We shall see them head of the table soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s nice to see a county that plays more than
one amateur doing well for a change,” Anthony
responded with alacrity.</p>

<p>Roger kept the conversation firmly upon cricket till
the inspector had swallowed his last mouthful and the
dinner things had been cleared away, and even till the
inspectorial pipe was well alight and the inspectorial
countenance decidedly bored.</p>

<p>“By the way, sir,” remarked Inspector Moresby,
relaxing comfortably in the armchair to which he had
transferred himself. “By the way, didn’t I hear you say
something about having solved the mystery?”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d come round, with time and gentle
treatment,” Roger laughed. “Yes, Inspector, joking
apart, I really think I have solved it. Care to hear?”</p>

<p>“Of course I would, sir. You mustn’t mind if I pull
your leg now and then.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do a bit of that myself,” Roger admitted.
“But look here, the trouble is Anthony. I haven’t told
him yet, because it’s all bound up with what you
confided to me the other night; but of course he wants to
hear. Can’t you stretch a point and let me just give him
a quick idea of what you told me?”</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated. “You’ll give me your word
that it wouldn’t go any further, then, Mr. Walton? Not
to another mortal soul?”</p>

<p>“On my oath,” Anthony agreed eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s highly irregular,” sighed the inspector,
“but—very well, Mr. Sheringham; fire away!”</p>

<p>Roger proceeded to give Anthony a brief outline of
how Meadows had met his death and the discovery of
the aconitine in the tobacco-jar.</p>

<p>“And that’s why I was so interested in tobacco this
morning, Anthony, you see,” he concluded, and went
on at once to acquaint the inspector with the new
discoveries he had then made.</p>

<p>The inspector nodded sagely. “Yes, I wondered
whether you’d get hold of that,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“You knew it already?” Roger asked, somewhat
dashed.</p>

<p>“A week ago,” replied the inspector laconically.</p>

<p>“But she never told me she’d told anyone before.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t know she had. She doesn’t know she’s
told you now. With that sort of person, if you don’t ask
’em direct questions but just let ’em dribble their
information out in their own way, they’ll tell you
everything they know just the same and they won’t realise
five minutes later that they’ve told you anything at
all. Yes, well, what did you make of it all, Mr.
Sheringham?”</p>

<p>Roger drew a deep breath.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch25">

<h2>Chapter XXV. <br> Roger Solves the Mystery</h2>

<p>“Well, I’d better begin at the beginning,” said
Roger.</p>

<p>“Now, in the very first place I made up my mind, as
you know, Inspector, that the person whom you seemed
to be suspecting (whether you really did or not, I don’t
know; but you certainly gave me that impression)—I
made up my mind that that person was not responsible
for Mrs. Vane’s death. The evidence was against her, of
course, and badly, but there are some cases where
circumstantial evidence, however apparently convincing,
can lead one rather badly astray, and I was sure this
was one of them. I admit that I had nothing definite to
go on; my reasons were purely psychological. I felt,
quite simply, that to suspect Margaret Cross of
murder—and a seemingly cold-blooded, carefully-planned
murder at that—was nothing short of ridiculous. The
girl was transparently sincere and honest.”</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t she, then, who was it?”</p>

<p>“Well, both of you know that my suspicions finally
centred upon this fellow Meadows, <i lang="la">alias</i> all the rest of
it. I thought I had a pretty good case against him even
before we knew anything about him at all; afterward
it almost amounted to a foregone conclusion. And then
Meadows apparently committed suicide. Well, that
didn’t affect my case; if anything (and the circumstances
being as they were) it was actually strengthened. But
Meadows, it turned out, could hardly have committed
suicide at all. He must have been murdered. How did
that make things look?</p>

<p>“Now, this is where we jumped to the wrong
conclusion, Inspector. At least I did, I can’t answer for you;
I’ve never known what was really in your mind from
the very beginning. Misled, intentionally or otherwise,
by you, I practically assumed that the two murders had
been committed by one and the same person—or if I
didn’t actually assume that, I came so near it as
automatically to wash out the idea that Meadows committed
the first. We agreed that they must almost certainly be
interdependent, and I accepted your very plausible
theory that the strongest and most obvious motive for
the second was that Meadows had been an actual
eye-witness of the first. And that theory of course eliminated
him from the list of suspects. At the same time you
made out a very useful case against Vane for the double
murder.</p>

<p>“And now I’m afraid we become a little personal.</p>

<p>“Thinking things over in bed last night, away from
your magnetic influence, I was suddenly struck by this
bright thought: <em>why</em> does Inspector Moresby go to such
pains to plant in my mind the idea that both murders
were committed by the same person, and to give me
the impression that this is what he himself thinks? He’s
a reticent sort of devil; he’s never volunteered any ideas
of his own worth speaking of before; he knows that in a
way we’re rivals here; the last person he’d want to help
toward a solution is Roger Sheringham—<em>why?</em> And of
course the answer to that came pat: because he wants
to put me on the wrong track! He <em>doesn’t</em> think those
murders were committed by the same person. On the
contrary, he’s convinced they weren’t. How’s that,
Inspector?”</p>

<p>The inspector laughed heartily. “No, no, Mr.
Sheringham,” he said, shaking his head. “You do me an
injustice, you do really. That was my honest opinion when
I was talking to you last night. I had no doubt at all that
Mrs. Vane and Meadows were murdered by the same
person and I don’t mind admitting it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” observed Roger, not altogether without
scepticism. “And do you still think so?”</p>

<p>“I’m always open to conviction, I hope,” replied the
inspector carefully. “Yes, go on, sir. This is very
interesting.”</p>

<p>“Well, whether you really thought there were two
murderers or whether you didn’t, my base suspicions
of you did me one good turn: they biased me in favour
of thinking so myself. So when I set out to pay a visit to
Meadows’ lodgings this morning, I was already
prepared to look for his murderer in somebody other than
that of Mrs. Vane. Well, I made my investigations, I
unearthed a few new facts which looked interesting but
which I was blessed at the moment if I could make head
or tail of, and I sat down after lunch to try to think the
whole thing out.” Roger re-lit his pipe, which had gone
out, and settled himself more comfortably in his chair.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t for some little time that a very simple
question occurred to me, to which the answer began at
last to put me on the right track. The question was this:
what after all has happened to make it so impossible
that Meadows <em>should</em> be the murderer of Mrs. Vane, as
seemed so obvious before? And the answer, of course,
was—nothing! Very well, then. Could I get any further
with the second mystery by utilising my theory of the
two agents to make Meadows the solution of the first?</p>

<p>“Now there were two pointers toward the murderer
of Meadows, both somewhat vague—motive and
aconitine. Assuming, as I think one had every right to do,
that Meadows would not have shrinked from
blackmail, the first of these was so wide that I shelved it for
a time and concentrated on the second. This was wide
too, but it could be narrowed down. If one took the
working assumption that the aconitine had come from
Dr. Vane’s laboratory, there were, excluding servants
and so on, three people who could have got hold of it:
Dr. Vane himself, Miss Williamson and Miss Cross.
Well, for some reason or other (psychological again) I
wasn’t drawn toward Dr. Vane as the murderer
although, as you showed, Inspector, it was possible to
make out a pretty convincing case against him—probably
because you <em>had</em> gone out of your way to make a
pretty convincing case against him, perhaps. In the same
way, of course, I had already discarded Miss Cross.
There remained Miss Williamson.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Williamson was a difficulty. Why in the
name of goodness should she want to kill Meadows? I
could see no possible reason. There would have been a
reason, of course, if she had already murdered Mrs.
Vane—an idea that had already occurred to me by the
way, Inspector, and for the same motive, before you put
it forward once as a joke, if you remember. There
would have been a motive in that case, if Meadows had
seen her do it; but I was working on the theory that he
had murdered Mrs. Vane himself. For the life of me I
couldn’t see, if that were the case, how she could
possibly be his murderess.”</p>

<p>“Out of the question, I should have said,” interjected
the inspector.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I decided. Well, there were all my
three suspects discharged without a stain on their
characters; so I was driven to the conclusion that either the
aconitine had not come from Dr. Vane’s laboratory at
all, or else Meadows had not killed Mrs. Vane. In either
case I was in an <i lang="fr">impasse</i> and had to go back a little
way. I went back to motive.</p>

<p>“Now this is where we really do begin to warm up.
Do you remember last night, Inspector, you asked me
who had the biggest motive for wanting Meadows out of
the way, and I replied, somewhat facetiously, that Mrs.
Vane had? I began to play with that idea.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Vane?” repeated Anthony incredulously. “But
she was dead already.”</p>

<p>“When Meadows died, yes; but she had plenty of
motive, I imagine, for wanting him out of the way
before she died herself. Anyhow you see the idea. I was
asking myself, with growing excitement: was there any
way in which Mrs. Vane could have brought about
Meadows’ death, although she herself was already
dead? And the answer, of course, was obvious. Yes,
there was!” Roger leaned back in his chair and beamed
triumphantly at his audience.</p>

<p>“This is very clever, Mr. Sheringham,” said the
inspector ungrudgingly. “Very clever indeed. Yes, I see
now what you’re driving at, but let’s have it in your own
words.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you probably discovered yourself, Meadows
had had no visitors during the last few weeks, so far as
the landlady knew. Any theory, then, which was to
cover the insertion of poison in his tobacco must
presuppose the murderer’s visit late at night and, probably,
through the sitting-room window, with or without
Meadows’ own knowledge. But on the night before the
murder the landlady, although awake, heard no sounds
at all, whereas she had heard a visitor’s voice, quite
distinctly, some three weeks beforehand, that visitor being
proved to be Mrs. Vane.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, sir,” said the inspector. “What’s all
this about? I don’t know anything of a visit of Mrs.
Vane’s.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Roger grinned. “Well, I’m one up on you there
at any rate. Look at this!” He drew the little handkerchief
out of his pocket-book, tossed it over to the other
and explained how it had come into his possession.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the inspector with a rueful air. “Yes,
you’re certainly one up on me there, Mr. Sheringham.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Roger with undisguised satisfaction.
“Well, to continue. Apart from the information
about Mrs. Vane’s visit, two other facts emerged: one,
that Meadows changed his pipes once a week, to which
no significance appears to attach, the other, that he was
a very small smoker—and that’s very important indeed.
I found out from the village shop, you see, that he
bought a quarter-of-a-pound at a time, but only smoked
it at the rate of an ounce a week. As he evidently
emptied the whole lot into that tobacco-jar in his room
which you sent away to be analysed, that would mean
that the bottom contents of the jar would remain in
place for between three and four weeks. For anybody
conversant with his habits, this knowledge might be
very useful indeed.”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded slowly. “Very ingenious, sir;
very ingenious.”</p>

<p>“Glad you think so, Inspector,” Roger smiled. “I’m
quite sure that praise from you is praise worth having.
Well, that’s my theory. Mrs. Vane and Meadows, to cut
a long story short, were both planning to murder each
other. Meadows believed in direct methods; Mrs. Vane
was more painstaking. Both their motives are obvious,
I think. Meadows had been threatening her with
exposure, no doubt, if she didn’t satisfy his financial
demands, which, as Mrs. Vane with her knowledge of the
type must have realised, would gradually grow bigger
and bigger. She had retaliated by threatening to inform
the police of his whereabouts, knowing that he was
badly wanted by them on more than one charge. The
result was that both had succeeded in thoroughly
frightening the other, and each decided on the other’s
elimination as the only escape from an intolerable situation.
That’s perfectly reasonable, I think?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” assented the inspector at once.</p>

<p>“Damned cunning,” commented Anthony warmly.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Anthony. Well, as I said, Mrs. Vane was
the more painstaking of the two. She elaborated her plan
with, I think, considerable ingenuity. Her knowledge of
poisons, you see, was probably two-fold; her father
was with a firm of wholesale chemists, you said, and she
might well have picked up a few tips from him, apart
from what she could have got out of her husband’s
books. She knew enough at any rate to recognise
aconitine as pre-eminently her requirement. And she hit
upon poison in the first place, I should have said,
because she had an unlimited supply of all brands ready
to her hand. What did she do, then? Simply this:
having made an excuse for visiting her real husband’s rooms
(necessarily in circumstances of profound secrecy), she
sent him out of the room on some pretext, slipped the
stuff into the <em>bottom</em> of his tobacco-jar, and went calmly
away to await developments.”</p>

<p>“Which turned out to be somewhat different from
what she’d expected,” supplied the inspector.</p>

<p>“Very much so. But of course she thought she was
on velvet. She knew the fact of her having been to
Meadows’ rooms that night would never leak out,
because it was to his advantage to keep quiet about it
(though it certainly was short-sighted of her to talk
loudly enough to waken the landlady); and having
placed the poison at the bottom of the jar, with two or
three ounces of harmless stuff on top of it, she knew that
it would be at least a fortnight before he would reach
it, and by that time she would be miles away with a
complete alibi established.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but how do you know that, sir?” asked the
inspector, with the air of one who puts his finger on a
weak point.</p>

<p>“Because Miss Cross happened to mention it casually
to Anthony!” Roger returned triumphantly. “I’d got
as far as that in my reasoning, you see, when it occurred
to me that the only possible purpose Mrs. Vane could
have in delaying the death was this one, to provide
herself with an alibi. If I could find out, I felt at that stage,
that Mrs. Vane actually <em>had</em> expressed her intention of
going away in the very near future, then my case was as
good as clinched. And up pops Anthony with the very
information I wanted!”</p>

<p>“So I haven’t lived in vain after all, Inspector, you
see,” murmured Anthony facetiously.</p>

<p>“Well, hitherto I’d been working entirely on
guesswork, but that seemed to give me the one bit of proof
I wanted. After that it was simply a case of using one’s
imagination to reconstruct what must have happened.
And what did happen can be put baldly in a couple of
sentences. Before Mrs. Vane’s ingenious scheme could
take effect, Meadows had pushed its author over the
cliff. Result, Meadows murdered Mrs. Vane and Mrs.
Vane murdered Meadows, in spite of the handicap of
being already dead herself. I should think that must be
the first time in Scotland Yard’s history that a man
had been murdered by a corpse, Inspector, isn’t it? If
I wanted to make a detective story out of it and was
looking for a nice lurid title, I should call it ‘The Dead
Hand.’ Well, now, comments, please. What have you got
to say about it all?”</p>

<p>“I’ll say this, sir,” replied the inspector without
hesitation. “It’s as clever a bit of constructive reasoning as
ever I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“And the idea had never occurred to you?” pursued
Roger, pleased.</p>

<p>“Never,” admitted the inspector handsomely. “And
so after all this excitement the public is to be
disappointed of an arrest, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid so.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>“Of course it isn’t capable of what you might
call <em>proof</em>, Mr. Sheringham, is it?” remarked the inspector
thoughtfully. “Not the kind of proof to satisfy a court,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t; I know that. But as they’re both dead,
justice isn’t going to be cheated.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to publish your solution in the <i>Courier</i>,
after the facts have come out at the inquest next
Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but only as an interesting theory, of course. I
don’t know whether there’s any law about libelling the
dead, but in any case I couldn’t very well do more than
put it forward as a workable solution, in the complete
absence, as you say, of all proof.”</p>

<p>The inspector smoked a few more minutes in silence.</p>

<p>“I think, sir,” he said slowly, “that you’ll find the
official explanation of the whole thing, for the benefit of
the public, will be that Mrs. Vane’s death was an
accident and Meadows committed suicide.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded. “Yes, I’d rather expected that. It’s
tame, of course, but it’s safe. Do you mean, you don’t
want me to attack that too fiercely in the <i>Courier?</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t want to stir up mud which it’s
impossible to clarify,” replied the inspector, in somewhat
deprecating tones.</p>

<p>“I see that. Very well, I promise not to be sarcastic.
You must let me put my theory forward, just as an
interesting piece of deductive reasoning, but I won’t
insist upon its being the truth.—And after all,” Roger
added, “I can’t defend it, except on the grounds of
probability and commonsense. However convinced we
ourselves may be that it’s the right solution, we’re
always up against this unfortunate absence of decisive
proof.”</p>

<p>The inspector nodded as if satisfied. “I think you’re
wise, Mr. Sheringham, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” remarked Anthony robustly. “What
about a drink?”</p>

<p>“Anthony,” observed his cousin, “your ideas are
sometimes nearly as good as mine.”</p>

<p>Anthony removed himself to the lower regions and
returned with the wherewithal for celebrating the occasion
fittingly. In the intervals of celebration, they continued
to discuss the case, the inspector now paying
ungrudging acknowledgments to his unprofessional rival’s
acumen and ingenuity. Roger decided that after all he
really liked that hitherto somewhat maddening man
very much indeed.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour or so later the recipient of Roger’s new
affection put down his glass with a sigh and looked at
his watch. “Well,” he said with deep regret, “I suppose
I’ll have to be getting along.”</p>

<p>“To interview Woodthorpe?” said Roger in some
surprise. “But surely there’s no hurry about that?”</p>

<p>“When a man bothers to confess to a double murder,
the least one can do is to ask him why,” the inspector
pointed out. “It’s merely a matter of form, I know, but
I think I ought to get it done to-night. I’ve got a
motor-bicycle outside; it won’t take me a minute. By the way,
Mr. Sheringham, how do you account for that, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>“Woodthorpe’s confession?” said Roger thoughtfully.
“Yes, that is a little puzzling, I admit. But you do get
all sorts of comic people confessing to crimes they
haven’t committed, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; they’re always doing it. Sort of
muddled mentality, I suppose. But you wouldn’t call
Mr. Woodthorpe a comic person, would you?”</p>

<p>“No, I certainly shouldn’t. There’s only one other
explanation that I can see—a super-quixotic sense of
chivalry. The village gossip must have reached him, and
he would naturally be acquainted with the other
members of the Vane <i lang="fr">ménage</i>.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit the nail on the head again,” the
inspector agreed. “That must be the explanation. No
doubt the report in the village is that I’m going to make
an arrest at any minute.”</p>

<p>“But super-quixotic, for all that,” Roger smiled.
“Now if it had been Anthony who had made the
confession I should have understood it much better.”</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” asked that
gentleman in high bewilderment. “This is all Greek to
me.”</p>

<p>“Then Greek let it remain, Anthony,” replied his
cousin kindly. “Greek let it remain. That shows the
advantage of a classical education.”</p>

<p>The low hum of a distant engine floated in through
the open window, increasing rapidly to a loud roar.</p>

<p>“Powerful sort of car, that,” Roger commented.</p>

<p>“That isn’t a car engine,” remarked Anthony, with all
the scorn of the mechanically-minded for those not
similarly gifted. “That’s an aeroplane, you ass.”</p>

<p>The inspector jumped hastily to his feet. “An
aeroplane, did you say?”</p>

<p>Anthony cocked an ear towards the now shattering
din. “Yes,” he was forced almost to shout. “Nearly
overhead, and flying low. Making for the sea apparently.
Young Woodthorpe celebrating his escape from arrest,
I expect. You can tell it’s a⸺”</p>

<p>“I must go and look into this,” observed the
inspector shortly, and vanished with rapidity. A minute later
the noise of a motor-cycle engine drowned that of the
swiftly receding aeroplane.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s the trouble now?” wondered
Anthony.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows,” replied Roger philosophically.
“Probably friend Colin is still trying to make himself
look guilty by pretending to do a bolt for the Continent.
Dear me, what a handicap to a man a super-developed
sense of chivalry must be! It’s as bad as a
disease.”</p>

<p>The next hour passed pleasantly enough; there was
plenty for the cousins to discuss, and Roger had not by
any means yet got over his elation at triumphing over
the inspector. He talked at considerable length. The
second hour passed more slowly. By a quarter to twelve
both were frankly yawning.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past twelve the buzz of a distant engine
heralded Inspector Moresby’s return. They heard him
pushing his bicycle round into the yard at the back,
and then his heavy tread on the stairs outside.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d gone for the night,” Roger greeted
him. “Well, was I right? Has Colin bolted for the
Continent?”</p>

<p>“He has, sir,” replied the inspector, shutting the door
and advancing into the room.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Roger, not without satisfaction.</p>

<p>The inspector was looking decidedly grim. He did
not return to his chair, but stood in the middle of the
room, looking down on the other two. “I’m afraid I’ve
got bad news for you, Mr. Walton,” he said slowly.
“Mr. Woodthorpe hasn’t gone alone.”</p>

<p>Anthony stared at him. “What do you mean?” he
asked, in a curiously high voice.</p>

<p>The inspector looked still more grim. “Miss Cross
has gone with him,” he said shortly.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch26">

<h2>Chapter XXVI. <br> Caustic Soda</h2>

<p>“Miss Cross!” exclaimed Roger.</p>

<p>The inspector continued to address himself to
Anthony. “You must be ready for a bit of a shock, I’m
afraid. It’s Miss Cross that Mr. Woodthorpe has been
engaged to all the time. She’s been just amusing herself
with you. She’s⸺”</p>

<p>“I think I shall go to bed,” observed Anthony
abruptly, and rose from his chair. “It’s pretty late.
Good-night, you two.”</p>

<p>He went.</p>

<p>The inspector watched the door close, then dropped
into his seat. “It’s a nasty smack for him,” he said
sympathetically. “But he’s young. He’ll get over it.”</p>

<p>Roger found his tongue. “But—but that is almost
incredible, Inspector!”</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him quizzically. “Is it, sir?”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it of her. Are you sure you’re not
making a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. I’ve known it for some time as a matter
of fact, but I couldn’t very well drop a hint to your
cousin.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Roger said slowly, readjusting his ideas
in the light of this startling development, “of course this
makes Woodthorpe’s confession a good deal more
understandable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I knew what he was getting at.”</p>

<p>“She must have shown him she was frightened,”
Roger pursued, thinking rapidly. “But the last time I
saw her she seemed quite all right. Something must have
happened since then. Inspector—you’re looking guilty!
Out with it!”</p>

<p>“I had a long interview with her this morning,” the
inspector admitted. “Perhaps I <em>did</em> press her pretty
closely. I knew she was concealing her engagement from
me, you see, so she might have been concealing other
things as well. Yes, I certainly did press her pretty
closely.”</p>

<p>“What you really did, I suppose, was to convey to her
quite obviously that you still suspected her after all and
that if she couldn’t produce a better explanation of
certain matters, she’d be finding herself very shortly in
distinctly hot water?”</p>

<p>“We have to do these things, you know, sir,”
confessed the inspector almost apologetically.</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness I’m not a policeman,”
retorted Roger, making no effort to conceal his distaste.
“No wonder you frightened the poor girl out of her wits.
I suppose you practically told her you were going to
apply for a warrant against her. The rest was inevitable,
of course. So what do you suppose is going to happen
now?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps when she finds there isn’t a warrant out
against her, Mr. Woodthorpe will bring her back the
same way as he took her away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re not going to apply for a warrant after
all?” said Roger sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Very nice for the girl’s reputation, I must say, to be
careering about the Continent with a young man for
goodness knows how long.”</p>

<p>“She’s engaged to him,” the inspector pointed out
mildly. “It <em>is</em> possible for them to get married abroad,
you know.”</p>

<p>Roger snorted.</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>“You seem very put out on her behalf,” the
inspector ventured, curiosity overcoming discretion.
“Considering how she’s been treating your cousin, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“She was a minx, I admit,” Roger said, with a little
laugh. “I also admit that she took me in properly; I
really thought she was quite fond of Anthony. But after
all, I suppose she had some justification. If she was
engaged to friend Colin all the time, the position must
have been a very difficult one for her, both before Mrs.
Vane’s death and afterward, whether she knew anything
about her fiancé’s intrigue with that lady or not. She
couldn’t admit the engagement while she was under that
cloud, you see, and all her energies must have been
concentrated on clearing her name. I don’t say she behaved
very nicely, but that must be the explanation. Having
had it forcibly impressed on her that not only public
opinion but the official police as well were dead against
her, she deliberately set out to attach Anthony to her in
order to make sure of getting him and me on her side
and enlisting our energies on her behalf. Don’t you think
that’s the truth of the matter?”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it, sir,” agreed the inspector heartily.
“That’s the truth of that all right.”</p>

<p>“And very well she succeeded,” added Roger
modestly. “Well, now that the whole thing’s at an end,
so to speak, Inspector, what about a little bed?”</p>

<p>The inspector’s answer was not a direct one. “So you
think the whole thing’s at an end, do you, Mr.
Sheringham?” he said, with a return to his quizzical expression.</p>

<p>“I do, yes,” said Roger, surprised. “Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m very much afraid it is,” the inspector agreed.</p>

<p>Roger looked at him. “What are you driving at,
Inspector? Have you still got a card or two up your sleeve?
You surely don’t mean to say you don’t accept my
solution of the mystery?”</p>

<p>The inspector puffed once or twice at his pipe. “If
you’d asked me that question before, when Mr. Walton
was still here,” he said slowly, “I should have said that
I did accept it. But as we’re alone—well, no! I certainly
don’t accept it.”</p>

<p>“But—but why ever not?” Roger asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Because I happen to know it isn’t correct, sir,”
returned the inspector placidly.</p>

<p>Roger stared at him through the blue haze of tobacco-smoke.
“Isn’t correct? But—but—well, dash it, man, it
must be correct!”</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. “Oh, no, sir, if you’ll
pardon me. It isn’t correct at all. You see, my trouble
hasn’t been to find out the truth; I’ve known that all
along. My trouble has been to prove it. To prove it, I
mean, definitely enough to satisfy a court of law. And
that I haven’t been able to do, and I’m afraid, never
shall. The truth’s plain enough, but there’s too many
gaps in the chain of legal proof. It’s a great pity.” The
inspector shook his head again, this time expressing
gentle regret.</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” Roger cried.
“Truth obvious all the time? What do you mean? I
haven’t found the truth obvious all the time!”</p>

<p>Once more the inspector shook his head, now
conveying the disappointed reproof of the master at the too
easy failure of a fairly gifted pupil. “And yet it was
staring at you in the face all the time, sir,” he said in
tones of reproach. “The trouble was you wouldn’t look
at it.” He drew again at his pipe for a moment or two,
as if collecting in his mind what he wanted to say.
Roger watched him in frank amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was your trouble, sir,” resumed the
inspector, in a slightly didactic voice. “All the time you’ve
been refusing to look the facts in the face. This was a
simple case, so far as just finding out the truth went;
as simple as ever I’ve come across. But that wouldn’t
do for you. Oh, dear, no! You must go and make a
complicated business out of it. As simple a little murder as
ever was, but you want to run about and raise all sorts
of irrelevant issues that had nothing to do with the case
at all.”</p>

<p>“Who did murder Mrs. Vane, then?” demanded
Rogers, disregarding these strictures. “If Meadows
didn’t, as you seem to be meaning, who the devil did?”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with you people with too much
imagination,” pursued the inspector. “A simple
murder’s never enough for you. You can’t believe a
murder can be simple. You’ve got to waste your time
ferreting out a lot of stuff to try to make it look less
simple than it really is. No good detective ought to have
too much imagination. He doesn’t need it. When
all⸺”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut the cackle for the time being!” interrupted
Roger rudely. “Who <em>did</em> murder Mrs. Vane?”</p>

<p>“When all the evidence points to one person, and
motive and opportunity and everything else as well, the
real detective doesn’t waste his time saying, ‘Ah, yes!
I know a thing or two worth that. When all the evidence
and the rest of it points to one person, then the odds
are that that person is innocent and someone else has
made it look like that. That’s how I should commit a
murder, by Jove! I’d fake all the evidence to point to
somebody else. That’s what must have been done in this
case. So whoever may be guilty, we know one person
at any rate who isn’t, and that’s the one that the foolish
inspector from Scotland Yard, who hasn’t got a nice
big imagination like me, is going to go and suspect.
Haw, haw!’ ” The mincing accent with which the
inspector strove to represent the speech of this superior
person with imagination was offensive in the extreme.</p>

<p>“Who murdered Mrs. Vane, Inspector?” asked Roger
coldly.</p>

<p>“Why ask me, Mr. Sheringham?” retorted the
inspector, still more offensively. “I’m only the man from
Scotland Yard, without any imagination. Don’t ask
yourself either, though, because the answer’s staring you
in the face; so of course you’d never be able to see it.
Go and ask any child of ten in the village. He’d know.
He’s known all the time, for the matter of that.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” Roger exclaimed, genuinely shocked.
“You don’t seriously mean that⸺” He paused.</p>

<p>“Of course I do!” returned the inspector more genially.
“Good gracious, sir, I can’t think how you can have
persuaded yourself she didn’t. Everything was against
her—every single thing! There wasn’t a loophole, so
far as commonsense went (I’m not talking about legal
proof, mind you). Of course she did it!” He lay back
in his chair and roared with callous laughter at Roger’s
unmistakable discomfiture. It was the inspector’s hour,
and he was evidently going to enjoy every minute of
it.</p>

<p>“But—but I can’t believe it!” Roger stammered.
“Margaret Cross! Good Lord!”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I ought not to laugh at you, sir,” the
inspector went on, continuing nevertheless to do so with
the utmost heartiness. “After all, you’re not the first
one to be taken in by a pretty face and a nice, innocent,
appealing sort of manner, are you? Why, there’s mugs
in London being taken in by ’em every day!”</p>

<p>The country mug winced slightly, but no words came
to him.</p>

<p>“Of course I wouldn’t be saying any of this if Mr.
Walton were here,” said the inspector, ceasing to laugh.
“It’d be a nasty shock for him, very nasty indeed; and
the one he’s got already is quite enough. You’ll keep it
all dark from him, of course.”</p>

<p>Roger found his voice. “Who killed Meadows, then?”
he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Why, the girl!” ejaculated the inspector. “She killed
’em both, I keep telling you. Meadows saw her with
Mrs. Vane, lay low for a few days, then sprang it on her
and started in to blackmail her, no doubt; probably
wanted most of that ten thousand pounds she was to get
under the will. So she finished him off, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” Roger cried incredulously.</p>

<p>“It’s true enough, sir,” said the inspector more
seriously. “I saw it all the time; knew he must have
been murdered when we found him there dead. It was
a nasty blow for me too, I can tell you, because he was
my only witness against her for the murder of Mrs.
Vane. That’s what I was going to arrest him for, as a
matter of fact, to keep him safe in prison and make him
talk—not because I thought he’d committed the murder
himself, like you; I never did think so. In fact, I knew
he hadn’t. Yes, she spoilt my case against her there
completely.”</p>

<p>“But—but look here, can you prove these
extraordinary assertions in any way, Inspector?”</p>

<p>“Well enough for commonsense, sir, though not
beyond all reasonable doubt, which is what the law wants.
Let’s take the two cases in turn. What were the clues in
the first one? The coat-button and the footprints. Well,
the footprints had been made by a number six shoe,
fairly new, the heels not worn at the side; Miss Cross
I found out, had been wearing shoes that afternoon
which answered to that description. That wasn’t
conclusive, of course; half-a-dozen people might have been
wearing shoes like that. But the coat-button was. There
was no getting round that. The maid was dead certain
that button had been on Miss Cross’s coat when she went
out, and there it was in the dead woman’s hand. That
would want a lot of explaining away.”</p>

<p>“But it <em>could</em> be explained away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; it could,” agreed the inspector
cheerfully. “I showed you how myself.”</p>

<p>“But what about those shoes I found in the sea? You
said they were Mrs. Russell’s.”</p>

<p>“So they were, sir. But what about them? You never
seriously thought those were really the shoes the
murderer had worn, did you?”</p>

<p>Roger choked slightly, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t believe you thought that,” continued the
inspector with relish. “Why, that was an old pair, not
new like the pair that had made those footprints. A
child could have seen that. Besides, they’d only been in
the water an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“What?” Roger cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you know that, sir?” asked the inspector
innocently. “Oh, yes; they weren’t much more than wet
through. And you don’t mean to say you never
recognised them, sir? Well, dear me!”</p>

<p>“Rub it in, rub it in,” Roger groaned. “Dance on my
body if you like. I’ve no doubt I deserve it. No, I didn’t
recognise them. Would you mind explaining to my futile
intelligence what exactly you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Well, seeing that you’d had them in your hands not
twenty-four hours before, I thought you might have
recognised them. Didn’t you get hold of a pair of Mrs.
Russell’s shoes, and give them to Miss Cross to give back
for you?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, you don’t mean to say <em>those</em> were the
ones?”</p>

<p>“Indeed they were, sir, as it wouldn’t have taken
you five minutes to find out, if you’d ever thought of it.
The girl lost her head a bit over that. It’s easy enough
to see what happened. You’d been putting forward the
idea that the murderer was a man, who’d made those
marks with a pair of woman’s shoes to throw us off the
track. She’s getting pretty desperate by then, seeing how
strongly I suspected her (I never troubled to hide that),
so she makes some excuse to get away, nips back to the
house, slashes the shoes up the sides to give the
impression they’d been prepared for big feet, and throws them
over the top of the cliff. Then she makes another excuse
to get you down on to the ledge, where they can be
found. Why, bless you, sir, <em>you</em> never found those
shoes! She did!”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly true,” Roger muttered. “She did. I
remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all plain enough as far as commonsense
goes, but no good for a court of law, I’m afraid. A smart
counsel could tear all that to shreds with his eyes shut.
The same with the second case too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on to that.”</p>

<p>“Well, there, sir, I really did my best to put you on
the right track. I <em>told</em> you that Meadows was murdered
by the same person who killed Mrs. Vane, and because
he’d seen the first murder done, I told you that, and I
told you that it must have been someone who had access
to aconitine. You said just now you thought I meant Dr.
Vane, but I didn’t of course; I meant the girl. And then
the funny thing is you thought I was trying to pull your
leg. Why, it’s all been staring you in the face. I’ve heard
you with my own ears talking with Mr. Walton about
how funnily Miss Cross was behaving, wanting to go
over to France one minute and stay here the next and all
the rest of it; and all you thought was that it was nerves.
So it was, but not the kind you meant!</p>

<p>“And I’d given you another hint long before that,
when I told you there was real bad blood in that family.
I told you straight out they were practically all of them
criminals; and still you thought she couldn’t be, just
because she had an innocent face. Of course the first thing
I’d done was to have the records searched for her at the
Yard, <em>and</em> found her in them too. Never actually been in
prison, you understand, but mixed up before she came
here with a very shady crew indeed; a house she got a
job in as a parlourmaid was burgled for instance, and
another where she was supposed to be the governess;
we never laid our hands on the lot that did it but there’s
no doubt that she was in with them, though nothing
could be proved against her. Oh, and several other things
too. She was a bad lot all right before she ever came
here, but clever—oh, yes, clever enough.”</p>

<p>“Go on to the second case,” said Roger feebly.</p>

<p>The inspector paused and marshalled his ideas.
“Well, now, there, sir, you made a very bad mistake
indeed,” he said with some severity. “You jumped to the
conclusion that Meadows was killed by aconitine in his
tobacco. If you’d troubled to read up aconitine as you
ought to have done, you’d have found out that it’s a
vegetable alkaloid, and vegetable alkaloids lose all their
power if they’re burnt. You can smoke as much
aconitine in your tobacco as you like, and it isn’t going to do
you any harm.”</p>

<p>“But that’s what killed him,” Roger protested.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it isn’t, sir, if you’ll pardon me. He was
killed by aconitine placed in his <em>pipe</em>, not his tobacco.
Aconitine was put in the bowl or the stem of his <em>pipe</em>,
sir, where his saliva melted it, and he swallowed it
before he knew what he’d done. And that not only proves
that it couldn’t have been put there three weeks before,
as you thought, but must have been during the previous
night, but also that it was put there by someone who
knew a little about poisons but not very much, for
otherwise there’d have been none wasted in the tobacco. She
meant to make sure of the job all right, by the way;
there was enough of the stuff there to kill a hundred
people.”</p>

<p>“But wait a minute!” Roger interrupted. “You’re
wrong there, Inspector. It <em>could</em> have been put there by
Mrs. Vane. I found out that Meadows only smoked his
pipes a week at a time, remember!”</p>

<p>The inspector’s expression was more pitying than
chagrined. “Yes, but did you find out when he changed
them, Mr. Sheringham, sir? I did, you see. On Sunday
mornings. So it couldn’t have been Mrs. Vane after all.
It was somebody who came during that previous night,
while he was asleep. It wasn’t the doctor, because he’d
never have put the stuff in the tobacco; there’s no
conceivable reason why it should have been Miss
Williamson; it <em>must</em> have been Miss Cross. But there again
there’s no absolute proof.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Roger, “I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p>The inspector helped himself with an absent air from
the bottle of whisky which stood, flanked by a couple of
syphons, on a small table at his elbows. He sipped his
drink thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And you’re not going to apply for a warrant?”
Roger asked, when all this had sunk into him. “You’re
going to let her get away with it?”</p>

<p>The inspector allowed a little whisky to sink into him.
“No help for it, I’m sorry to say. We could never get a
conviction. As I said, I think you’ll find that the verdict
next Thursday will be suicide, and we shall let it rest
at that; the verdict of accidental death on Mrs. Vane as
well. It isn’t the first time this has happened, you know.
There’s any number of people walking about to-day,
free men and women, that we <em>know</em> to be murderers, but
we can’t prove it to the satisfaction of a court.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that, of course,” Roger nodded. “Legal
proof is a very different thing from moral conviction.
Well, I must say I’m not sorry. They were two
distinctly unpleasant specimens of humanity of which she
ridded the world, and I should be sorry to hear of her
hanging for them. But—poor Colin!”</p>

<p>“Be thankful she hasn’t got into your own family, Mr.
Sheringham, sir,” replied the inspector philosophically.
“And I daresay she won’t make him a bad wife when
all’s said and done. It was his money she was after, of
course; now she’s got that, and an established position,
she may settle down all right.”</p>

<p>“Not the sort of wife I’d choose myself for all that,”
Roger said with a little shiver. “Yes, she must have been
after his money, I suppose. As no doubt Mrs. Vane was
before her.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the inspector meditatively. “I’m
inclined to think Mrs. Vane wasn’t; I think she was
genuinely fond of the boy. Margaret knew about her
affair with him, of course, and that was another reason
for wanting her out of the way. That’s why the
engagement was kept so secret too. She knew her cousin would
never give him up to her, and would certainly cut her
out of her will as well. By the way, it may interest you
to know that the doctor’s marriage settlement is
invalidated, as Mrs. Vane was never his legal wife; I had
the wording looked into and a legal opinion taken. So
the girl doesn’t get that ten thousand after all.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Much Ado About Nothing,’ ” Roger commented
ironically.</p>

<p>“Or ‘The Dead Hand,’ ” smiled the inspector. “That
was a good title of yours after all, sir, because it was
the button in Mrs. Vane’s dead hand that makes the
whole thing so certain.”</p>

<p>Roger stifled a yawn and looked at his watch. “Good
Heavens, do you know it’s past two, Inspector? We’d
better get to bed. Though whether I shall sleep very
much is another question. All this is a little upsetting,
you must understand.—By Jove,” he added as he rose to
his feet, “do you know, even now I can hardly believe
that she did it!”</p>

<p>The inspector smiled at him tolerantly as he also rose.
“Because she looked pretty and innocent, and you
thought at one time she might be going to make a match
of it with your cousin, sir? Because you saw her, in fact,
as the pretty little heroine of one of your own books?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Roger admitted.</p>

<p>The inspector patted him on the shoulder with a large
and consoling hand. “Do you know what’s the matter
with you, sir?” he said kindly. “You’ve been reading
too many of those detective stories.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
